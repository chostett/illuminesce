Welcome to my personal website and blog! I'm a design researcher, artist and game dev that made their own personal website to disconnect from the centralized web and reconnect with other small web builders. I'm not a professional programmer so my code may be janky. I try.

## How I built this
This site is built with HTML/CSS/Javascript, using the following templates (mostly for the blog):
- [Zonelets](https://zonelets.net/) for the blogs
- [Zonelets tags](https://3legged.neocities.org/journal/posts/2023-03-12-Creating-A-Zonelets-Tagging-System) by 3legged on neocities
- [Comment widget](https://virtualobserver.moe/ayano/comment-widget) by Ayano

Feel free to reach out to me at **cj@studioterranova.net** if you want to chat.
I also update [cohost](https://illuminesce.cohost.org). My Twitter/Tumblr/Facebook/Instagram are things I check infrequently. I'm tired of social media.
