      <h2>IWAKAN Issue Archive</h2>
      <p>IWAKAN was a Japanese queer and art magazine published between 2020 and 2023 that questioned stereotypes and what was considered "normal" in Japan. It is part art magazine, part queer zine, part activist discourse, featuring interviews from a host of performers, drag queens, queer community activists, feminists from in and outside of Japan.

        Below are links to summaries, publication dates and the table of contents of each IWAKAN issue, published on their online store. I have provided English translation for the issue titles and summaries.

        As someone who lives in Japan and is part of the queer community, I wanted to preserve a part of IWAKAN here in case
        the site goes down. I don't want to see this collection of personal stories and radical discourse lost to a broken
        link.

        <em>Iwakan</em> (違和感) is an uncomfortable feeling or sense of discomfort. The magazine's tagline
        is,「IWAKANは、世の中の「当たり前」に「違和感」を問いかける雑誌です。」or "IWAKAN is a magazine that questions what is "normal" and what is
        "discomfort" in the world."
