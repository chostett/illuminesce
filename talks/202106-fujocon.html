        <h3>Transcript</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ (they/them):</strong> Good evening! Good afternoon to those of you who are in Asia.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees (he/him):</strong> That's me!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> My name is CJ, and this is mabbees. By day, I'm a software designer and design researcher who does ethnographic research into the way people use technology. And in the evening, I'm an indie game dev.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> And I'm three bunnies in a trenchcoat. For work, I mash buttons on keyboards and hope that it somehow turns into working code. It does, most of the time.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> The project that we're working on is Terranova, an interactive video game that takes place in the early 00's. In this game, you follow the lives of three <em>fujoshis</em>; EphemeralSmile, CherryGoRound as you chat them, befriend them, and discover yourself through a rich world of storytelling, love and friendship. You can check it out at playterranova.com. It's in beta right now, and <s>it will be out this year</s> it released in April 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, why do a panel about history?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Slide: Understanding fandom through historical records and the tools people used</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> As you can imagine from our retro-looking game, we've been very interested in what made the 2000's feel special and nostalgic. We've been taking a look at online history and the anthropology of fan culture around that time. What were the tools people were using online?
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't have a definitive answer on what made the 2000s special, but we'd like to share some of our thoughts with you today.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Slide: Images of young people cosplaying (dressing up as a character), collapsed on the floor. Some scribbles on an arm that says, 'Michihiro Kuroda.'</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> In addition to being amateur historians, we actually lived through these times. It may not look like it now, but I'm the person cosplaying Ryuichi in this Gravitation group. Shoutout to the Gravitation panel that's happening later today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these people were folks that were hugely formative to my identity at the time. These are folks that I met at Otakon in 2004, and they are people I met online long before the convention. I still keep in touch with them today. Also, for some reason, I wrote the lead singer of Iceman (Mihihiro Kuroda)'s name on my arm...but anyway! I was sixteen.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> Nerrrrrd! <em>(CJ laughs)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Slide: A timeline spanning from 1930's to 2020.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd like to start with a brief history of important events of fandom history in the United States. We can break this timeline into roughly three partsâ€”the <em>pre-internet</em> days, the <em>early internet</em> up until about, say, 2007, and the <em>the modern internet.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason why I like to take this zoomed out version of history is that it gives us a chance to notice patterns. Mostly today we'll be looking at the early internet, but let's take a look at the pre-internet fandom first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine you're a Star Trek fan in the 1970's. You've gone to your first Star Trek fan conventions and you've discovered there are people like you who "ship" Kirk and Spock. You get together and start writing this new, cool genre called <em>slash.</em> It was very novel at the time. You publish some fanzines, until one day, some of the other Star Trek fans start to notice. And some are really unhappy with you. In fact, even the show creators call you out.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            "Gene and the executives at Paramount feel that slash is harmful to the Star Trek concepts as this was never the intention in creating this series."
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Luckily, this story has a happy ending. In 1984, a group of slash writers got together and started their very own convention, IDICon. In a way, I think it's the precursor to FujoCon.
        </p>
        <p>
          But we see this pattern happen in the early internet days as well; mostly on Geocities, LiveJournal and del.icio.us. Those aren't the only sites fans were using, but we feel they were a very influential part of the early fandom in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Slide: Lifecycle of a Fandom. A circular flow of 1. Finding a community, 2. Creative hacking, and 3. Resilience.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Our fan communities in the early internet follow a similar pattern. They form a community, do something creative together, and eventually respond to challenges and regroup.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> Imagine you're a person, much like myself, who grew up in a conservative town in the United States. You have some friends who like anime, but they say, "like the weird stuff."
        </p>
        <p>
          You like the weird stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          And you think you're the only one. And one day, the internet arrives at your home, on a CD-ROM entitled, "Try AOL Online. Thirty days free." <em>(Sound of a gritty dial up modem plays.)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          Let's go back to 1997.
        </p>
        <p>
          An important part of finding people like you is signaling, "hey! I like this thing. Does anyone want to join me in liking this thing?" Geocities and Angelfire were sites that allowed anyone to make their own, personal pages or shrines for things they liked. But because they were all separate sites, they needed a way to link to each other and form communities. So Geocities had neighborhoods that different communities could rally around. For instance, computers, video and roleplaying games were located in Times Square, so if your site covered any of those interests, your site would be in the "Times Square" neighborhood. You could find other people who had interests like you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> Anime, and anything "Far East" related topics were in the "Tokyo" neighborhood. I think we've come a long way since 1997 around cultural awareness.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> This allowed people to find each other's webpages and view websites of people they didn't even know and get to know them a little bit better. These neighborhoods eventually were discontinued, but the popularity of the link list remains. For instance, here at FujoCon people are sharing their recommendations on Google Docs or link lists on people's personal sites.
        </p>
        <p>
          The concept of <em>webrings</em> has persisted into the modern age. Having a community around say, Sailor Moon or Gundam Wing where different sites link to one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Slide: Many different animated GIF icons of anime characters; pixel art and badges.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Does anyone remember these or had any of these on their sites?
        </p>
        <p>
          These are pixel sprites that you could add to your personal site that signalled the things you were into or the type of fan you were. For instance, if I was into Sailor Moon or a specific character in Sailor Moon, I might put these Sailor Moon sprites on my site. Or these Gundam Wing sprites, which I'm pretty sure I had at least Trowa and Quatre on my site. I probably had all of them. <em>(laughs)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>Pocket Bishonen</em> is a site where you can "catch" sexy men by answering three-question quizzes about them; you could also challenge gyms by trying a 12-question quiz about the series. You can still find them at pocketbishonen.com and I will say that mabbees and I successfully caught all four of these Pocket Bishonen ourselves. (Sho from Moonchild, Inu Yasha, Homurai from Saiyuki, and Yuki from Fruits Basket)
        </p>
        <p>
          You could also signal what you believed in; for instance, there was a "hentai-free" movement where people could signal that they didn't believe in having hentai or erotica in fandom. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> Or my favorite, the "Hentai Free Free" movement, which was a counter-movement to show your support for erotica and disdain for censorship.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> So you found your community. You're lonely no longer. Now...what's next?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> And everyone got together on their private Discord servers, wrote fanfic, and published it on AO3. Except they didn't, because none of those things existed yet! Instead, we had to make the best out of the tools that we had at our disposal. To get creative and get hacking.
        </p>
        <p>
          In doing research for Terranova, something I've been inspired by is how creative and ingenious the fandom community has been when it comes to using the online tools that they had available. CJ already mentioned cool things like Geocities and Pocket Bishonen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Around this time you start seeing fans doing online roleplay together, either on IM or forums, or by posting it to their
          blogs. In 2021, it's easy for us to take that for granted, but nothing like that really existed before. Nothing like that <em>could</em> exist in the same way. And the tools we were using, they weren't ever designed for writing collaborative fiction. But people used them that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of my favorite examples, and this is from late 2008, is the "askverse" which started off as a LiveJournal blog called, "Ask Captain Jack." This was from the Torchwood fandom, so Captain Jack Harness is a favorite and sexually lascivious character. One fan started a blog where fans could ask anonymous questions using LiveJournal's ask box feature, and they would respond entirely in character as Captain Jack.
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            Kids, I know you're all sexily shoveling the space-snow off the space-Plass, but pay attention to two things: 
            <br>
            1) I need more egg nog, my mug is empty! Christ, don't make me nog my own eggs. :-(
            <br>
            2) Check out this weird reading! It blip-blooped up on the Rift monitor when you were struggling into your space-snowpants...
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          A second example, and this comes from the late 00's, comes from the <em>Warrior Cats</em> fandom. If you're not in the know, Warrior Cats were a series of young adult novels and they had a really interesting and ingenious fan followingâ€”on the nook store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine you were a bored teen in the suburbs with nothing but books for entertainment. You're really into Warrior Cats. And you're not reading paperbacks, you're reading on your nook e-reader. Until one day, you realize you're not just holding a book, <em>you're holding a roleplaying device.</em> You check the Warrior Cats reviews and see roleplay happening there. You decide to respond. And they respond to you. 
        </p>
        <p>
          You're using an e-reader not how it was intended; it was intended for reading books and writing reviewsâ€”and it's not an elegant solution for what you're trying to do. A lot of the reviews end up being posted anonymously; you can't reply to them directly, your messages might get jumbled or out of order, but you go for it anyway. Because...
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Slide: A sexy photo of Jeff Goldblum reclining with his shirt off; text says, "Fandom Finds a Way."</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Fandom finds a way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Third and final example of fan ingenuity comes from a site called del.icio.us. This was a site for tagging and bookmarking other websites. It was also one of the first social websites because you could make your tags public so that other users who followed you could see them; and you, in turn, could see other people's tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Slide: a simple bookmarking site, del.icio.us used tags like chekhov/sulu to denote pairings, D/s to denotate kink, chapters-read:12 to mark your place in the fanfic, and ^allthefeels for tagging "vibes" of a fanwork.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          So fandom got real creative and in depth in how they used del.icio.us to tag things online. They started doing things
          like tagging bookmarks for fanfics or fanart using pairings like "harry/draco" or "chekhov/sulu." They also started tagging for content, for bookmarking, and tagging things with a comment or other things you want to say about a fic.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what was cool about del.icio.us is that if you started typing in the search box, you you get auto suggest results so if you start typing pairing colon you can see
          pairing colon kirk spock harry slash draco etc etc so it may not be ideal but with the tools you have at your disposal
          you've hacked together a cool online fandom you found ways to make it work the fandom is flowing and you're jamming with
          your community until until [ __ ] goes down eventually fan communities have to deal with some kind of reckoning a common
          source of this tension is between
