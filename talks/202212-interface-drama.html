        <h3>Transcript</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> Hi, I'm CJ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> And I'm mabbees!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> We're hobbyist game developers, and have been making experimental games since the early 00's. We made a go-karting game called Channel Drive, a co-op VR game where you split a headset between three people called “Three Monkeys”, and a waffle-making simulator presented in “smell-o-vision.” Most of these were quick prototypes that we've set aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> But in 2019, we found a game concept that piqued players' interest, and also fueled our passion for making it. So we wanted to see it through to a higher level of completion and polish. That game eventually became Terranova, a game set in the early 2000's about fangirls on the internet, released in April this year and is...
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> <em>(whispering cheekily)</em> ...out now on Steam and itch.io!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> When we first made Terranova, we weren't really sure how to describe it to our friends. When they'd ask what we made, we'd say, "We made a cool game!" and then <em>they</em> would say...
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> "Oh, like Super Mario?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> "No. Not exactly. It's like a...a text-based game."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> "Oh, like a choose-your-own-adventure. I used to love those books."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> "Sort of,” we said, “but it has characters you can meet in the world. And the choices you make affect their relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> "Oh, I got it! Like a visual novel."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> But it also has solitaire?!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> This is usually how our conversations go. But <em>sometimes</em>, our friends will say, “Oh, it's just like...”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            (at the same time)
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> <em>Hypnospace Outlaw!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> <em>Secret Little Haven!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>(they both look at each other in confusion.)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> And that's when we realized we weren't just struggling to describe <em>our</em> game—we were struggling to describe a <em>genre</em> of games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nerd Nite is about diving deep into an unknown world, so allow us to invite you into ours. It's a world where stories and software collide. A world full of esoteric and sometimes very intimate games.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> Tonight, we’d like to talk to you about a new, emerging genre in video games. Sometimes they are called “desktop simulators,” or “UI games,” but if we may be so bold, we'd like to suggest a new name... <strong>interface dramas.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose the words “interface drama” because these games use interfaces, which are the interactive parts of technology. Think buttons, scrollbars, and things you can poke and push.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they use interface to tell dramas, or immersive stories. They are usually incredibly personal and human.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some examples. Interface dramas look like the software and apps we use on a daily basis, except they use these interfaces to tell stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          After playing a lot of these interface dramas, and after developing one, we found four common traits of this genre...
        </p>
        <h3>1. You are the main character</h3>
        <p>
          You are the main character. We’re not just saying you “control” the main character. When you play Mario, you make Mario run and jump by pressing buttons. But in Terranova, the main character, Tourmaline’s actions are the same as yours. When she posts a blog on her PC, you post a blog on your "PC." Sure, when you choose actions she may respond in a different tone than you, but she is meant to be some kind of representation of the player. There’s very little distance between you and her.
