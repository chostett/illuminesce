        <h3>Transcript</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> Hi, I'm CJ.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> And I'm mabbees!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> We're hobbyist game developers, and have been making experimental games since the early 00's. We made a go-karting game called Channel Drive, a co-op VR game where you split a headset between three people called “Three Monkeys”, and a waffle-making simulator presented in “smell-o-vision.” Most of these were quick prototypes that we've set aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> But in 2019, we found a game concept that piqued players' interest, and also fueled our passion for making it. So we wanted to see it through to a higher level of completion and polish. That game eventually became Terranova, a game set in the early 2000's about fangirls on the internet, released in April this year and is...
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> <em>(whispering cheekily)</em> ...out now on Steam and itch.io!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> When we first made Terranova, we weren't really sure how to describe it to our friends. When they'd ask what we made, we'd say, "We made a cool game!" and then <em>they</em> would say...
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> "Oh, like Super Mario?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> "No. Not exactly. It's like a...a text-based game."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> "Oh, like a choose-your-own-adventure. I used to love those books."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> "Sort of,” we said, “but it has characters you can meet in the world. And the choices you make affect their relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> "Oh, I got it! Like a visual novel."
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> But it also has solitaire?!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> This is usually how our conversations go. But <em>sometimes</em>, our friends will say, “Oh, it's just like...”
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>
            (at the same time)
          </em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> <em>Hypnospace Outlaw!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> <em>Secret Little Haven!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>(they both look at each other in confusion.)</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>CJ:</strong> And that's when we realized we weren't just struggling to describe <em>our</em> game—we were struggling to describe a <em>genre</em> of games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nerd Nite is about diving deep into an unknown world, so allow us to invite you into ours. It's a world where stories and software collide. A world full of esoteric and sometimes very intimate games.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>mabbees:</strong> Tonight, we’d like to talk to you about a new, emerging genre in video games. Sometimes they are called “desktop simulators,” or “UI games,” but if we may be so bold, we'd like to suggest a new name... <strong>interface dramas.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          We chose the words “interface drama” because these games use interfaces, which are the interactive parts of technology. Think buttons, scrollbars, and things you can poke and push.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they use interface to tell dramas, or immersive stories. They are usually incredibly personal and human.
        </p>
        <p>
          These are some examples. Interface dramas look like the software and apps we use on a daily basis, except they use these interfaces to tell stories.
        </p>
        <p>
          After playing a lot of these interface dramas, and after developing one, we found four common traits of this genre...
        </p>
        <h3>1. You are the main character</h3>
        <p>
          You are the main character. We’re not just saying you “control” the main character. When you play Mario, you make Mario run and jump by pressing buttons. But in Terranova, the main character, Tourmaline’s actions are the same as yours. When she posts a blog on her PC, you post a blog on your "PC." Sure, when you choose actions she may respond in a different tone than you, but she is meant to be some kind of representation of the player. There’s very little distance between you and her.
        </p>
        <h3>2. It has an immersive environment focused on story</h3>
        <p>
          It has an immersive environment focused on story. In Her Story, everything about the interface; the old school windows, the scan lines and the shine on the monitor. This accentuates the feeling of using an old police computer to catch a killer. This is one of the very first clips you search. “I didn’t murder Simon,” a woman says, which immediately begs the question, “then who did?”
        </p>
        <h3>3. It uses interface elements to add tension to the drama</h3>
        <p>
          Simulacra is a psychological horror game about finding someone’s lost cell phone. It creates tension from something mundane by using smartphone interface conventions in an artful way. The sudden interruption of a phone call, flashing lights, a creepy ringtone. And the mood game goes from calm to deeply anxious.
        </p>
        <h3>4. It rewards players for being curious</h3>
        <p>
          The game rewards players for being curious. Look at this page that I found in Hypnospace Outlaw. “Hiding Occult References in Utmost Secrecy?” And it needs a password to access? Think of the interface drama like a sandbox with treasures hidden in it. The purpose isn’t to win; it’s to find all the treasures and unlock the full story.
        </p>
        <p>
          At its core, this is what interface drama is: an immersive story told through software and app interfaces. You might ask, “is this really a new genre of game?” So let’s talk about interface dramas in context of other games and what makes them different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interface Dramas take direct inspiration from many pre-existing genres of games. In the red circle, we have the more closely related game genres. Simulation games, for example Microsoft Flight Simulator or Densha de Go! are games that simulate real life, like flying a plane or driving a train.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual Novels, like Higurashi no Naku Koro ni or Doki Doki Literature Club, are games that focus on telling a story that players can (sometimes) influence the outcome of.
        </p>
        <p>
          Point and click adventures, for example, Secret of Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle, are puzzle games where a player explores a world and clicks on objects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternate reality games like Evidence: The Last Ritual and Subtext are games that use out-of-game interactions to make the player believe the story happening in the game is also happening in real life, like emailing or calling the player. Moving outward, are more distant influences: Interactive Fiction and Text Based Adventure Games are games with
          text only — no visuals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Text Based Adventure Games like Colossal Cave Adventure and Zork used of natural language processing, technology pioneered by conversation systems that weren’t originally meant for gameplay. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, there was an early research project in natural language processing called ELIZA. It was a basic chat bot that tried to parse your text and respond in the style of a psychotherapist. You would say “My dad doesn’t get me” and it would say “Why do you feel like your dad doesn’t get you?”. With adventure games you could type “light the lantern with the match” and it would say “You aren’t holding a ‘lantern with the match’”. Brilliant. The gameplay often involved solving puzzles to make
          progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interactive Fiction, by comparison, has less focus on puzzle solving, and instead asks the player to make choices that can influence the outcome of the story. They expanded on a concept that predates games entirely, and comes from books like Choose Your Own Adventure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s talk about each of these genres and how they compare to interface dramas.
        </p>
        <p>
          Puzzle-solving is a common trait amongst many of these games, and interface drama shares this too. Their main mechanic is about “unlocking” the next part or the story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sim games, ARGs, and Interface Dramas all aim for a level of “realness,” or “verisimilitude.” Interface dramas are usually modeled off of interface elements that the player has seen before, for example an Android or iOS interface on a smartphone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interface dramas, as well as Visual Novels and Point-and-click Adventures—like their literary roots—revolve around characters who grow and develop as the story unfolds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that we’ve talked about how interface dramas exist in context with other games, let’s talk about how and why they’re different than simulation games, visual novels, point and click adventure games, and ARGs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternate reality games commonly break the 4th wall and pull in other out-of-game experiences. In Evidence: The Last Ritual (2006), the player is a detective investigating the serial killer The Phoenix. The player enters their email and over the course of the game, is emailed clues by the killer, so the game is both played from the disc and via email.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in interface dramas the action happens solely within the software. For example, Cybele makes use of email; but rather than using the player’s actual email, they can check Cybele’s email within the game. This is to immerse the player in the feeling of using the software, not to take them out of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Visual novels tell stories through narration and spoken dialogue. In Umineko, the player narrates the story as they
          experience it, and the characters speak directly to the player. For example, “It was a dark and stormy night when I saw
          her. Her hair was shiny and gold.”
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Gold-haired woman:</strong> “Hello.”
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, interface dramas tell stories through in-context text and clues. For example, in Hypnospace Outlaw,
          you find out that a character has broken up with his girlfriend not because he directly tells you—but he updates his
          status as, “sad face” and his girlfriend’s page has changed from a picture of them together to her talking about someone
          new.
        </p>
        <p>
          Simulation games and interface dramas both mimic real life things. But they have different purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
          For simulation games, it’s often to get to experience something you wouldn’t otherwise be able to do like fly an airplane, drive a train, or power wash an old house. Or maybe to drill a scenario to get you ready for the real thing, but in a low-stakes environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          For interface dramas, the purpose is to tell stories. Readers uncover clues because they want more story, rather than want to be the best at, “using a Windows interface.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Point and click adventure games and Interface Dramas both tell stories and pose puzzle challenges using visuals, but the kind of pictures on screen are much different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adventure games portray fantasy worlds in lush detail, whereas interface dramas portray software—sometimes in intentionally low detail in order to evoke a mood or a time period.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re not the first ones to try to name this genre. Here’s why we think our label is better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Desktop Simulators - it’s too narrow. Not all interfaces are desktops. It also alludes to simulation games which are not usually story driven.
        </p>
        <p>
          UI Game - it’s really generic sounding. Lots of games have UIs, or even focus strongly on the UI. Would Space Team count? To me, the heart of games like Secret Little Haven is the story. The Drama.
        </p>
        <p>
          So why should you care about interface dramas?
        </p>
        <p>
          Easy to learn. You can jump right in! If you know how to use a smartphone, you know how to play SIMULACRA.
        </p>
        <p>
          They can be historical artifacts. Our game Terranova is set in the year 2004, so it uses the design vocabulary of the day— things like Windows XP,
          Microsoft Solitaire, and early web 2.0 sites like LiveJournal.The game helps preserve some of those things in a kind of time capsule. You can no longer use LiveJournal the same way it was back in 2004. The site has long since changed its look. But our in-game version, LimeJournal, keeps the spirit alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          They’re new and fresh. The genre is still young, and still in some ways figuring itself out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interface dramas tell a more diverse range of stories than the power fantasy tropes that pervade a lot of main-stream games.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the interface dramas we’ve played we’ve come out to our parents, we’ve come of age, we’ve taken on big corporations and stuck it to the Man, we solved cold cases, and we went toe to toe with a haunted smartphone. The recent interface dramas tell interesting stories we’ve never seen before, and we’ve been playing games for a long time. And also oftentimes very QUEER!
        </p>
        <p>
          They’re really fun! They’re really fun. Do you want to take care of an “egg friend?” Post your spicy role-play on Limejournal? Hack the
          inner workings of your computer? Interface dramas let you do things you used to do in Web 1.0—but they also let you do things you could *never* do in software. Not legally, anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          So that brings us back to the question—what is our game, Terranova?
        </p>
        <p>
          Terranova is an interface drama. It uses an old Windows XP interface to tell the stories of four high school girls in the year 2004. They go to school. They stay up until 2AM. They struggle with loving who they want to love.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s a story about growing up, coming out, and realizing that you’re not alone. All in a tiny chatbox.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for listening.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to get your hands on some interface dramas, well...have we the list for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://bit.ly/interface-dramas" target="_blank">Here they are!</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          This isn’t an exhaustive list, but it contains many of the games we mentioned in this talk. And our game is Terranova at playterranova.com.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you.
