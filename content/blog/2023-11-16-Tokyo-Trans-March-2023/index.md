_This post originally appeared on cohost.org on November 16th, 2023. I'm keeping it here as an archived version of what happened to the Trans March in 2023. Thankfully, this [did not stop the trans community from reorganizing on November 17th 2024.](https://www.instagram.com/tokyotransmarch/)_

The 2023 Tokyo Trans March has been indefinitely postponed and will not be happening this weekend, [announced via their website as of November 9th.](https://transmarch.jp/2023/11/09/report002/)

I wanted to understand what was going on, so I took some time to figure out what was going on via their official Twitter + organizer's Twitters + some blogs. At the end of it all, I was exhausted and sad.

_Psychic damage warning: this contains mentions of sexual assault, transmisogyny, patriarchal bs, and in-fighting in the JP trans community._

Here's a brief summary translated to the best of my ability. The main documents I'm working from are these official statements from Transgender Japan, the statement of the accused refuting assault happened, and a friend of the victim, though I haven't yet found anything from the victim herself. I'll include original links in here in case anyone has corrections.

On Feb. 14th at an event that was not run by Transgender Japan (TGJP), 「LGBTQ+臨時国会〜理解ではなく差別を禁止を！〜」a transman head member of TGJP (the accused) had a shower in the hotel room of a woman (the victim).

The accused claims he put his hands on her back while she was turned away from him and surprised her. The victim claims that he gave her a full body hug naked, and that he previously admitted to doing so, as well as falling asleep drunk with his shirt off, but changed his story later on.

October 7th, eight months later, the victim accuses the head member of TGJP of sexual assault and sexual violence. She previously went to others about the incident, which then began the spread of rumors about the accused being a sexual predator. According to TGJP and the victim, they make some attempt to settle the issue between the two of them, and trust broke down between the two of them and TGJP.

As the rumors about "a sexual predator being part of TGJP" spread and that "TGJP supports a sexual assailant" circled on Twitter, many prominent LGBTQ+ organizations did not want to align themselves with TGJP and instead withdrew their support for the Tokyo Trans March. _(2024 CJ: previous link was on Twitter, but has since been deleted.)_

It is because of this massive withdrawal of support from the LGBTQ+ community based on a still-unresolved and unclear bad situation between two members of the community, in addition to a vicious rumor mill both within the community and outside the community on Twitter that TGJP decided to cut their losses and not continue with the Tokyo Trans March. They also suspended the accused from activities with the TGJP.

Some of the comments on Twitter towards the Transgender Japan organization are pretty awful, considering that no one has the full facts. People accusing a transwoman member of TGJP who _was trying to mediate the situation_ of being a sexual predator herself because she opted against gender affirming surgery. People telling the accused and TGJP that they are like Johnny's, an incident of an agency protecting a child predator for over 50 years because the situation was unable to be mediated.

I'm not going to guess what happened between the victim and the accused. I don't know. I don't have the full facts.

I don't agree with TGJP's mulling over the issue until it exploded into a massive fire online. But I also don't know what resolution the victim wants in this situation. What reparations would need to be made in order for the victim to feel heard, understood, and assisting them to heal from that February incident?

As a complete third party to the situation, this isn't the first time I've heard this kind of accusation in the LGBTQ+ community in Japan and this is not the first time a fight between two people spiraled out of control and ended up taking away valuable resources from the community (PURX comes to mind here).

Mostly, I'm hurt, angry, and disappointed in the JP trans community at large, that we attack one another and spread rumors we heard when we should be asking questions and trying to heal.

_It's always a process. It really lifted me up hearing there was another march this year; I heard about it too late this year but next year I'm hoping to be involved in volunteering._
