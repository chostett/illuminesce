![Rainbow USB keys with the word 'Terranova' printed on it.](./terranova-usb.png)

Our game, [Terranova is going to be at BitSummit!](https://bitsummit.org/en/game/terranova/) This is our first in-person event, so I wanted to make something special.

I hand-screenprinted these USB sticks that will have the game + a steam key included; excited to show off these colorful dudes. Printing on a 3.3cm surface was crazy difficult.
