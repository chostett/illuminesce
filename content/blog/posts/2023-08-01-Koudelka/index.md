Just finished [another stream of Koudelka](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1887218028). It's wild to me that these graphics are low poly and yet so evocative.

There was a part I played through tonight where Koudelka is bent forward in pain because she's channeling the spirits of the dead and is obviously in pain. Edward leans forward to try to touch her. She immediately yells, "don't touch me! Fuck off!" and he steps back, appalled.

The whole thing was so well-choreographed and, for the time, pretty well voice acted. If you've played video games from the 90's you know how overly-voice acted they were. Koudelka has a bit of that, but still manages to be somber.

Spoilers and more gushing below.

Koudelka, and by its extension, Shadow Hearts, were all about delivering the lore through the descriptions of the creatures the player fought. After Koudelka and crew find out the monastery had, at one point, been used as a jail cell where prisoners were tortured and left to rot, they must fight this enemy:

> _"A zombified woman dressed in a decaying wedding gown, with the veil still partly attached. Spurned by the man who loved her, she was left to rot in the Monastery prison. For cruel amusement, the guards forced her to wear her wedding dress and locked her away. Death is her only release."_

That's awful. And what's more awful is knowing how the guards mocked and disrespected this woman before her spirit attacked us. Perhaps the initial intent of the game devs was to make the whole game eerier, but after playing both moon RPG Remix and Undertale I wonder if they'll ever make a Shadow Hearts where one possible play through is to commune with the spirits and calm them, rather than treating them like enemies.
