I've been doing some brushing up on the history of graphical user interfaces (GUI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) as supplement for writing about [interface dramas.](https://illuminesce.net/interface-drama)

Old papers on technology and HCI in the 1960's~1990's are fun for me to burrow into because you'd be surprised just how little Silicon Valley *instigates* innovation instead of *imitates* innovation that was done many years ago by radical inventors.

For someone like me who is burnt out on tech companies that fetishize "the grind" and reporters that joke about "computers taking our jobs," it is refreshing to see inventors who made technology in the 80's talk about how this technology is about *working with* humanity, *augmenting* people, or *giving people power against authority.*

It's a much more radical and disruptive way of thinking than what I hear from modern tech companies who claim they are radical and disruptive.

Douglas Engelbart, the inventor of the modern mouse, presented the "Mother of All Demos" where he video-calls into an auditorium from his lab 13 miles away, shares his screen and shows how he uses the computer to collaboratively make a shopping list with his wife.

*In 1968.*

Hearing Engelbart speak is realizing most of Steve Jobs' stage presence, and the "revolutionary" way Apple did product announcements, was them parroting and tweaking the "Mother of All Demos" that was done 10 years prior to Apple's founding.

Engelbart believed that computers should be accessible to everyone; not just people who were trained in using computers. He believed computing *augments* human intelligence and should be designed to replicate the way we think, rather than us adjusting our way of thinking to fit computers'.

It's different to the messaging I hear from tech journalists half-joking about workers "needing to learn how to write good prompts for AI, or else they'll get replaced by ChatGPT" as if AI was something that wasn't a tool designed by humans and as such, should be able to accept a diverse number of human inputs.

Another inspiring invention is Steve Mann's *EyeTap*, a wearable, mounted camera that could record video through eyeglass.

It was invented in 1984, years before Google Glass or GoPro.

He went on to explore the concept of "[sousveillance](https://www.academia.edu/63760578/Sousveillance)" through installing cameras on his person and living his day to day life. He did many experiments over many years as "the person who watches the watcher."

Here's what he discovered—in the 90's that there was a slow decrease in peer discomfort in personal body cameras. However, there was a sharp increase in organizational discomfort from law enforcement, art galleries and jewelers. These organizations in specifc installed security cameras to film patrons, employees, or customers.

In the 90's he was forcibly thrown out of an art gallery by security guards without discussion for wearing cameras on his person. The reason they gave was "copyright infringement."

"How is it," he writes in his 2004 paper *Sousveillance*, "that a painting hung on a wall gets more protection [from personal cameras] than a painting worn on a T-shirt of a person [that is actively being filmed by organizational cameras]?"

I wonder if Steve Mann thought it ironic that Google was the one who chose to make Google Glass—it wasn't so revolutionary as it was a natural extension of their surveillance into the day-to-day lives of the wearers.

Is it revolutionary to wear glasses designed by a company whose bottom line is monetizing user data?
