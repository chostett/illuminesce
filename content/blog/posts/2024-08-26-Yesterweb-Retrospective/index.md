This was a long time coming. After watching the Rebuilding Community on the (fujo) Web at [Citrus Con](https://www.citruscon.com/) this weekend, it unlocked a lot of thoughts on my involvement with the Yesterweb I've been reluctant to type out.

Part of the reluctance stems from my own mixed feelings—the Yesterweb was a really cool space that I believed in; then it lost a lot of enjoyment. Another is that I don't like "call out" posts—rather, I'm focusing on things I've learned from being a part of the Yesterweb. Perhaps this will be useful to others as well as indieweb/smallweb communities thrive.

First, some context: I love fan communities on the web. I've never seen a group of people so dedicated to "hacking it until we make it" when it comes to expressing their own creativity and putting adult works on the web for other 18+ fans to enjoy.

In 2021, [**@mabbees**](https://mabbees.neocities.org/) and I did a talk, which turned into a zine article for the Yesterweb Zine called ["The Birth, Death, and Rebirth of Slash"](https://zine.yesterweb.org/issue-00/index.php?page=7) that covers a brief history of how the fan scene of LiveJournal and delicious was censored or mangled for fans.

With the current degradation of the centralized internet and more and more people retreating to smaller places, this was a perfect time for a "small web renaissance." This is how I came to find the Yesterweb.

I'd participated in the Yesterweb community Discord actively during some of their formative years making zines (2021~2022). I had a lot of good memories with the Yesterweb, However, as the movement grew, I left, due to two things:

-   being asked not to promote our indie game on Discord and on the Yesterweb Radio - but noticing that AAA games were being shared openly
-   This rule: "Please don't share or discuss kinks, porn, content depicting sexual acts, etc."

Let's talk about the first one. I mentioned our game in our first article in passing for the [first zine article on slash](https://zine.yesterweb.org/issue-00/index.php?page=7), [built a full game for Hall-O-Zine](https://illuminesce.itch.io/costume-panic), then wrote a piece about [including marginalized voices in nostalgic discourse.](https://zine.yesterweb.org/issue-03/index.php?page=5)

The third link initially had more mentions of Terranova as I was actively researching nostalgia from non-white communities to build the game. I was invited to speak on Yesterweb Radio, then the invite was rescinded. I was also asked to remove any mention of our game from the third article—either to remove or rewrite it. I rewrote it.

The reason was that our game was paid and therefore "commercial." The Yesterweb was "anti-commercial" so they didn't want to promote our game to an audience that would be vulnerable to "nostalgia marketing." At first, I agreed though I didn't completely understand—I wanted to agreeable and part of the group—but what really confused me was that there was no requests to the members themselves to stop posting links to AAA paid Steam games Overwatch and Fortnite links were shared, paid DLC was shared, but I was not allowed to mention the game I'd worked on as an indie group.

The second one, the rule about not discussing kinks, porn, or content depicting sexual acts was something [**@mabbees**](https://mabbees.neocities.org/) and I questioned—being old queers on the Net we know what the "you can go somewhere else but you can't hang out here" dogwhistle looks like, and that looked like a blanket ban on adult content or creators.

Adult artists and queer artists often turn to the smallweb for their projects, and kink/sexuality/queerness is inextricably linked—kink and queerness is messy, and yes—the smallweb should have messy parts. We had initially thought the Yesterweb was accepting of this, and this didn't make sense to us; but then when we read the responses and realized the mods weren't open to discussion, we were disheartened.

The response we got was that this content might be "sensitive or triggering" to people who had been abused and therefore should not be permitted to make others uncomfortable.

We also heard that "there are many other spaces you can go online to do this." This is untrue. There are not many spaces to do this. It is the reason why adult artists make their own websites.

Finally, after a short discussion that more or less ended in a "if you don't like it, then leave," comment, I understood. From a moderation perspective, if the Discord was already open to all (including non 18+ folks) then there's extra moderation that needed to happen. The mods didn't have time, interest or energy to put in the work to moderate it. Sexuality is _messy_, so not inviting it at all made sense to them. This wasn't explicitly stated—they still maintained the position they were open to everyone, just not open to discussion from adult artists or people who were pro-adult artists.

My take? It was their Discord, so they could moderate or not moderate it the way they wished. But it didn't sound like that was what they were publicly preaching—[that they were committed to social responsibility and collective well-being, and encouraging conflict amongst people with different experienced.](https://yesterweb.org/#manifesto)

It took the excitement I had out of working with the folks on the Yesterweb.

So I quietly left.

Later, I heard they closed down.

suboptimalism posted a blog about the Yesterweb's move from Discord to forums and [the chaotic and dramatic shutting down of the Yesterweb.](https://suboptimalism.neocities.org/writings/yesterweb) A quote as to why it shut down:

<div class="quote">the reasoning for the shutdown the staff give at the start of the thread seems to be something along the lines of "the community is too big for us to moderate and nobody we trust has stepped up, so we're going to shut the whole thing down to prevent anyone from exploiting what we've built".</div>

It's understandable that there was too much mod work for a small community—having worked as an organizer for small communities before, this is very much the case, and in order for a small community to grow dynamically it must empower its members to create action.

But this comment in particular stung:

<div class="quote">staff member auzziejay explains early on in the thread:</div>

<div class="quote">"There are too many opportunists, too many people that used the YW for financial or even just social gain. We thought maybe the issue was the discord server-it wasn't. It was a systemic issue."</div>

(2024-12 edits:) After reading this, Auzzie kindly reached out to clarify—this quote in particular wasn't directed at Yesterweb *members* but rather another _mod_ that was trying to subvert the space for their personal gain. I didn't realize this. 

I'm revising my statements here in light of that.

Rather than focus on [Costume Panic!](https://illuminesce.itch.io/costume-panic) or Terranova, I'll share what I shared to Auzzie: that my takeaway after reflecting on this post is this: 

I still feel wary about trying out new indie web groups due to our conversations in the Discord with sadgrl and some other members of the Yesterweb around their banning talk around sexual content, adult content and kinks.

The way mabbees and I first thought to make our own sites was through the queer adult artist community, so suddenly hearing we couldn’t talk or congregate around the things we made was both surprising and a little sad. We thought maybe we could talk openly about it, but the more we tried, the more we got comments that we were either sexual predators or didn't care about CSA victims, sans evidence or any instigating event.

sadgrl replied in the same thread echoing a softer version of that—that we had to consider abuse survivors, but not asking other members to stop accusing us of being predators. It made me realize we'd made a mistake - thinking we were seen as friends and supporters of a indie web community. But actually, we were seen by some as predators or people with nefarious intent, with no particular reason as to why.

But, I met some really rad people in the server too, particularly HEX BOMB who I contributed to their zine [OUR SPACES WERE NOT MEANT FOR US](https://hex-bomb.itch.io/ourspaces) about adult artists and the web. Prior to the ban on adult content, we met on the Yesterweb Discord. They're cool people.

I discovered another grassroots organization called FujoCoded that has been talking openly about collective activism in the fujoshi/BL space. They talked about organizing folks to revive the smallweb again after a talk at CitrusCon this weekend and I compiled a resource list of all the topics they spoke on, namely:

* resources for beginner coders
* resources for adult artists
* collective action and founding coops

[Here's the list if you'd like to take a look.](https://illuminesce.net/fujoweb2024)

I'm glad to have been a part of the community before it transferred over to the forums, and I don't regret making zine articles or games for the Yesterweb. It was fun.

I'm also aware that as someone who associates themselves with queer adult artists, it means people might have some kind of idea of who I am before they know me. They might think they know who I am, but honestly...they don't.

I can’t change what people think about me; only how I behave in the world.
