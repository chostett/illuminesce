_This post was in response to [@MrHands](https://cohost.org/illuminesce/post/2814183-as-a-professional-ux) post on cohost about book recommendations for UX designers. I happen to be one of those, so I chimed in. I hope folks find this book list useful._

_The Design of Everyday Things_ is a good start. I see it get mentioned as a good starter book to understand the theory of UX (or as we used to say years ago, _interaction design_), but not necessarily the applied parts of design. I'll caveat this by saying this is all for software design. If you'd like more recommendations on game design, let me know.

As a designer, there's several applied skills that are necessary for doing design:

* **UX research:** What do you build? Who are you building for? How do you get feedback when you build it?
* **Sensemaking and goal-setting:** You have feedback from the customer, feedback from your boss, and someone tells you to make a thing. How do you choose what thing to make? Should you be making a thing at all?
* **Information architecture:** How will you express this new thing in words? How does it integrate into the pre-existing system (if there is a system)? If not, how do you show what is important to your customers?
* **Interaction design:** Your thing needs to be digital. Ok, how do you express that in digital space through UI and interactions?
* **Universality and accessibility:** People have different needs. How is your design going to be usable by everyone, not just someone that has the same faculties as you?
* **Communicating design:** How will you prototype this to get feedback? How are you going to sell this to your client/the business? How are you going to work with programmers to make this design real?

This isn't an exhaustive list. Digital systems exist within a larger service structure, so understanding customer journey maps and service blueprints will help you understand how the thing you're making fits into the larger service.

## Books/articles I'd recommend are:

### On UX research

* [Just Enough Research](https://abookapart.com/products/just-enough-research) by Erika Hall

### On sensemaking, goal-setting and information architecture

* [How to Sense of Any Mess](https://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/) by Abby Covert
* [Outcomes Over Output](https://outcomesoveroutput.com/) by Joshua Seiden

### On interaction design

* [Microinteractions](https://microinteractions.com/about-the-book/) by Dan Saffer
* [Laws of UX](https://lawsofux.com/)

### On universality and accessibility

* [What is universal design?](https://99designs.com/blog/tips/universal-design/)
* [Microsoft's Inclusive Design portal](https://inclusive.microsoft.design/)

### On communicating design*

* [Presenting Design Work](https://abookapart.com/products/presenting-design-work) by Denise Jacobs
* [Design is a Job](https://abookapart.com/products/design-is-a-job?_pos=1&_sid=f7ed7dd70&_ss=r) by Mike Monteiro

_* Note that when it comes to communicating with programmers, agile and scrum is popular in software teams, so it helps to understand the concepts around it. [I made a series of posts on Medium about mixed design and scrum teams a few years ago that might help](https://medium.com/yamaneco/hidden-challenges-of-design-and-agile-pt1-8639f913d516) if you're in a scrum team and want to try design practices._

Hope this helps.
