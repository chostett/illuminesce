As some of you may already know, my co-dev and partner [**mabbees**](https://mabbees.neocities.org/) is very into music. He plays the cello, piano, and guitar, and has a great voice. He did the PICO-8 music for our game, Tomodachi 8in1.

I am biased, but multiple sources close to me say that he's quite talented. He even [did a talk on musical modes for Nerd Nite Tokyo](https://youtu.be/TPb9KejlTR4?si=sHivYOcobUwFgkcZ)! It's one of the most-watched videos on Nerd Nite Tokyo's YouTube.

For the past few months, he's been practicing with a friend's band for a Christmas concert, and in December he did his first live. I'm not above shamelessly bragging about him, and I'm very proud.

I recorded their concert and uploaded them for Vimeo for friends and family. The band's name is 五芒星, or "Pentagram" in Japanese.

## All I Want for Christmas is You

I was shocked they chose this song as their opener, because I couldn't even sing this high pre-T without some serious warmups. The lead singer, Sake, has _balls of steel_ and a great voice. Respect.

## Santa Claus is Coming to Town

Classic.

## ステキなホリディー (Suteki na Holiday)

Original artist Mariya Takeuchi. This was the first time I'd heard this song, but apparently it's a Christmas classic.

## Jingle Bell Rock

That opening lick! So jazzy. This was probably my favorite song to listen to, partially because I like Christmas jazz, but also because I knew how hard mabbees worked to nail the lick.

I know if I were to tell him he was talented, he'd shrug and smile—but really, the thing that impresses me the most about his music is how thoughtful and hard-working he is. Talent is something that's assumed one _intrinsically has_, but being hard working means time and effort was put into getting better every day.

He puts in a lot of creativity and hard work into everything he does, and I deeply respect and adore him for it.

## Speaking of

I'm so grateful to be surrounded by deeply creative and hardworking people.  [**perroquadrado**](https://perroquadrado.neocities.org/) is a natural-born tinkerer and makes some really cool little experiments.

My friend, **Crystal De Forest** and her partner make video games — as of recently, she released a really sweet T4T romance called [Prisoner of the Mist](https://air-gong.itch.io/prisoner-of-the-mist) that I played a week or so ago. I really resonate with some of the themes there — and as much as I love dark, gothic themes, I'm a romantic at heart. It strummed some very warm heartstrings of mine.

And finally, my longtime friend Cloudy, who has always been [my drawing senpai.](https://bsky.app/profile/cloudymau.bsky.social/post/3le3uhjhtuc2c)

Y'all give me inspiration every day to make stuff.
