As some of you may already know, my co-dev and partner [**mabbees**](https://mabbees.neocities.org/) is very into music. He plays the cello, piano, and guitar, and has a great voice. He did the PICO-8 music for our game, Tomodachi 8in1.

I am biased, but multiple sources close to me say that he's quite talented. He even [did a talk on musical modes for Nerd Nite Tokyo](https://youtu.be/TPb9KejlTR4?si=sHivYOcobUwFgkcZ)! It's one of the most-watched videos on Nerd Nite Tokyo's YouTube.

For the past few months, he's been practicing with a friend's band for a Christmas concert, and in December he did his first live. I'm not above shamelessly bragging about him, and I'm very proud.

I recorded their concert and uploaded them for Vimeo for friends and family. The band's name is 五芒星, or "Pentagram" in Japanese.

### All I Want for Christmas is You

I was shocked they chose this song as their opener, because I couldn't even sing this high pre-T without some serious warmups. The lead singer, Sake, has _balls of steel_ and a great voice. Respect.

### Santa Claus is Coming to Town

Classic.

### ステキなホリディー (Suteki na Holiday)

Original artist Mariya Takeuchi. This was the first time I'd heard this song, but apparently it's a Christmas classic.

### Jingle Bell Rock

That opening lick! So jazzy. This was probably my favorite song to listen to, partially because I like Christmas jazz, but also because I knew how hard mabbees worked to nail the lick.

I know if I were to tell him he was talented, he'd shrug and smile—but really, the thing that impresses me the most about his music is how thoughtful and hard-working he is. Talent is something that's assumed one _intrinsically has_, but being hard working means time and effort was put into getting better every day.

He puts in a lot of hard work into everything he does, and I deeply respect and adore him for it.
