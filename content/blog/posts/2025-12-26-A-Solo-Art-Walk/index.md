My glassblowing teacher introduced me to the [Kurokawa Satoyama Art Project](https://midoritomichi.art/), a group that organizes an art walk in Kawasaki in November. They blend sculptural ceramics, glass, and metal into the natural scenery. I’d been sick most of November, so was pleased to catch it on the last day.

Life in the suburbs of Tokyo is accented by seasons of exchange; someone has too much such-and-such in their backyard—*would you like some?* The time of the year is kaki - feral persimmons sag laden with orange fruit against a blue sky. Women carry paper bags so full of them they defy their square shape.

Kurokawa is on the edge of the suburbs. The 3.8km art walk is through parks and backwoods that are transformed every year into a sculpture garden. I am given a map explaining where to find each of the sculptures and the hunt begins.

For today, I’ve put aside my rational brain and transported myself into a gauzy fantasy world that combines nature and art seamlessly. Sculptures reflect on the coexistence of the organic and inorganic. I find my teacher’s dangling glass plates that reflect *just right* as to be both barely visible and otherworldly.

This time last year there was a Christmas wreath making workshop in the park. There are no shrieks of children but it is bustling with activity. A kindly older man asks me in English where I'm from. I answer. After a few moments of silence, he says suddenly, "I don't get art. If there's no explanation, how do you understand it?"

"I don't think it needs an explanation," I reply. We both crane our necks to look at a ten-foot tall elliptical tower constructed from tree branches. It was a group project from the local Kurokawa art school; the plaque displays their names. "Sometimes it's enough for them to know for you to love it.”

I imagine the students spending weekends together weaving the tree branches and my heart is full.

A number of artists’ works pay tribute to Palestinians—grieving the terrible loss alongside their fellow humans and relaying a hope for regrowth, for small moments of happiness amidst atrocity.

I reflect on [an interview from a Palestinian poet](/blog/posts/2023-11-22-Gaza/) I heard on a podcast two years ago:

> *“There’s a beautiful saying in Arabic... “the remainder is in your life.” It is a saying that believes in the continuum of memory and the life force. What we do is sharing the remainder of the lives of those who have been lost.”*

The life force pulses through these works.

In the backwoods, I weave through fields of vegetables, and notably, momiji trees that are being grown to transplant into shrines or backyards. It looks like the green room of a play; the trees are huddled close together, not yet ready for their debut. There's a sense of wonder in the air. It has been a long time since I've felt that.

This year I've adopted a poisonous mindset around wonder; that it is a luxury afforded only to those who live carefree lives. I've been too busy focusing on *the real news*—that is, what is happening in the US.

To quote Adolus Huxley:

> *“No man can concentrate his attention upon evil, or even upon the idea of evil, and remain unaffected. To be more against the devil than for God is exceedingly dangerous. Every crusader is apt to go mad. He is haunted by the wickedness which he attributes to his enemies; it becomes in some sort a part of him.”*

I am afraid this wickedness has become a part of me. I can more clearly articulate what I hate than what I love. I hate violence and cruelty. I hate inaction in the face of injustice—the uncaring, always-turning gears of the political, patriarchal, colonialist and capitalist system. 

I don't live in the US and feel guilty. Since the start of the pandemic, the gap between my lived experiences and my friends and family in the US has widened significantly.

I hate my own sense of helplessness. 

Japan is no "golden" country—it has very little, if not underground support for transgender folks and does not have same-sex marriage.

Since transitioning on paper, I have spent a majority of my year meeting the dreaded Japanese bureaucracy system head-on, numbing the pain and pulling myself into an objective frame of mind to articulate "what is currently wrong" and "how can this be fixed" so that I can gain allies with logic. This has had the long-term effect of numbing my ability to feel joy. I am functional, yes, but I have lost my ability to live.

A nearby tree is adorned with glass sculptures; crystals jutting from the bark as if they naturally grew. I take a picture; then put my phone away and linger by the tree, trying to recreate the memory in my mind for later.

"Do you want a sweet potato?" a farmer interrupts from the road. “It's 100 yen."

"Really?" I say, "I'll take five."

The confusion on her face says something went awry. "You want...four bags?" she asks. "That's a lot of potatoes."
I flush. "Oh no, one bag is fine!"

The potatoes are freshly harvested and caked with dirt. I smile. "Wow!"

"You're pretty excited about them," she remarks with a smile. It's clear I'm playing the role of the naïve city slicker—*wow, 100 yen for potatoes!*—but I lean in to the stereotype. "I *am* excited. I *love* sweet potatoes."

I surprise myself with this admission. It seems silly, but I do. “Thank you!"

The art walk ends in an outdoor café; as the sun lingers over the horizon, I feel no guilt in the pleasure I savor in the afternoon stillness and aroma of coffee. I love solitude, too. These walking dates I take myself on are some of the most prized jewels I can make of my time. They remind me of the present, of who I am, who I love, and what I yearn for.

The present sun is setting.

I am a tired, but happy queer person.

I love my partner, our animals, making things, books and sweet potatoes.

I yearn to feel again.

My fellow outdoor gallery-goer asked how he could understand art if it had no explanation. It is not the point of all art to come with an explanation. Things understood with the mind can be explained, but things felt with the heart escape words. Articulating and understanding what has gone wrong helps me decide what to do next, but it does not help me grieve or heal, or feel joy.

I read [Devon Price's "Laziness Does Not Exist" in October](/blog/posts/2025-10-02-Laziness-Does-Not-Exist/) and it's taken a month for me to truly put my understanding into practice. There are so many barriers to savoring happiness and slowing down. Especially when going through a hard time, I don't want to remember things. I don't want to remember most of this year. 

But going through a hard time and savoring the good moments are not mutually exclusive. No one makes it out of this life alive. Why not spend our time savoring the good?

Escaping explanation, I feel, for the first time in a long time, rested.
