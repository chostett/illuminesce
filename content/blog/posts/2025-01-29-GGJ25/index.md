If this is your first time reading my blog‚Äîhello, and welcome. I'm CJ; I'm the site organizer of [Let's Games! Tokyo](https://globalgamejam.org/jam-sites/2025/lets-games-tokyo) which started in 2020.

This year was, in my opinion, one of the best jams Let's Games! has hosted. We had an even mix of Japanese speakers and English speakers. Half of our participants were first-timers. To each and every one of you who participated, thank you. You contributed to the joy and energy that we all felt at the end of the jam. I hope to see you in 2026!

The theme this year was *Bubble.* We had 44 participants and 11 games: 2 Unreal, 4 Unity, 1 Godot, 1 PICO-8, 1 Ren'Py, 1 JavaScript, and 1 board game.

Check out the games here.

Choose your social persona and rise to the top by tricking --er, persuading--others to go along with your solutions to current world events. (Unfortunately, the dog always dies...)

![People talking animatedly at tables while holding cards.](ggj25_03.png)

Huge thanks to Code Chrysalis for letting us use their space. This year, they had some great accommodations for sound engineers, like recording booths, so a lot of our games had sound! And thank you to Unity for sending us folders and pens for all the jammers. We appreciate your support.

At the site, I heard Japanese, English, French and Korean being spoken within the teams. About a third of our site were native Japanese speakers‚Äîa majority were bilingual speakers and a smaller percentage English-only. It truly was an international environment.

![Two people standing next to each other, presenting a game off a laptop. One person is Japanese; the other is French.](ggj25_05.png)

Several folks asked me how I made this environment: although I may have set the intention and we co-organizers may have designed it, the participants who showed up and are willing to have fun are the ones who ultimately make it.

I intend to publish a longer document on the design of the jam, if only to help other organizers make their own jams more multilingually friendly, more inclusive of beginners, and hopefully more fun overall.

## Let's Games! Tokyo Polish Party

As an extension of our event, we are hosting a polish party (not Polish!) on March 1st for teams to brush up their games and re-demo them in a casual atmosphere. Venue is currently TBD. Admission is free to Let's Games! Tokyo 2025 participants. We'll let you know more details on our Discord and newsletter.

## The Future of the Site

I want this cool space to continue.

![A person showing off a whiteboard and smiling. He is wearing a mask.](ggj25_05.png)

At the moment, I'm so involved in the organization that if I get sick, there might not *be* a jam. I'm thankful I haven't, but going forward I don't know if I'll always be that lucky.

So I'm asking anyone who has been a part of the jam before...would you consider volunteering? Or even step up to co-organize with me next year? I'll teach you what I know.

Next year's jam dates will be **January 30th-February 1st 2026.** Mark your calendars! And reach out to me at **illuminesce (@) pm.me** if you're interested in volunteering. I'll add you to our Discord.

To each and every one of you‚Äîcongratulations. You made a game! Whether it was weird, rough, or experimental, you made it.

Pat yourself on the back.
