Last Winterseve, [**mabbees**](https://mabbees.neocities.org/) gave me a book on How to Use Procreate. It uses project-based learning to teach the reader about basic to advanced Procreate techniques, and I started on a mini-project aimed at teaching how to build your own color palette and shortcuts for large-batch doodles. The project was for custom chat stickers.

I did the exercise, put it away for a while, then came back to finish it. Introducing...Mochi and Mugi the Eggbuns!

This is **Mochi.**
