![A sign in tall grass featuring a hawk and the words, 'Watch Out, Greedy Tobi is Coming.'](tobi.jpeg)

**Text in Japanese:** トンビにご注意ください。食べ物の空から取ってくることがあります。

**Text in English:** Watch Out! Greedy Tobi is coming.

This is such a perfect representation of how English translations of Japanese text completely lack context.

**Me, reading the Japanese:** Oh, I see. Watch out for hawks. They have been known to snatch food from people out of the sky. Thank you, sign.

**Me, reading the English:** GREEDY TOBI?!? WHO IS HE?!? WHEN IS HE COMING
