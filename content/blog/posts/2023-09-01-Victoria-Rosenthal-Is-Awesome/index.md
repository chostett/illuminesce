I'm usually not a huge fan of anime or video-game inspired cookbooks because I've historically had good-looking but not excellent tasting recipes, but Victoria Rosenthal's books are great. I have The Ultimate **Final Fantasy XIV Cookbook** on my shelf and the hot chocolate is one of my mainstays.

She makes a lot of the recipes either vegetarian-friendly or easy to substitute veggie-friendly options. Even if you don't like the games, some of the recipes here are really inspired. Here's a list of her recipes she's put up for free. There's recipes from Baldur's Gate 3, Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and more.

Try 'em out! As for me, I'm gonna make some [Jack Frost Coffee](https://pixelatedprovisions.com/2021/12/01/smt-nocturne-jackfrost-coffee/), hee-ho.
