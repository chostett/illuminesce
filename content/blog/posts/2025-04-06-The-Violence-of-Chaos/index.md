**Content warning: this contains talk of U.S. politics and intimate abuse.**

Recently, I've been floating in and out of doomscrolling the 24-hour U.S. news cycle. I'm the kind of person who, when I can't understand something, will pore over books, papers, and video essays until I've consumed enough information to synthesize some sense out of it.

When I couldn't understand why Trump won the 2016 election, I read both Barry Goldwater's [The Conscience of the Conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Conscience_of_a_Conservative) and Richard Hofstader's essay [The Paranoid Style in American Politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Paranoid_Style_in_American_Politics).

When I was trying to wrap my head around the surge of online callouts in queer communities, I reached for books on non-violent communication and transformative justice.

I first try to understand something with my head before my heart. And while I can grasp how we came to this point in the U.S., my heart aches. It is twofold every time I hear a lawmaker gleefully threaten deportation while assuaging the public, "don't worry, we'll only get the bad ones" — and to a public, who, after hearing lies throughout the 90's about ["lazy" immigrants or "welfare queens"](https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/blog/from-mothers-pensions-to-welfare-queens-debunking-myths-about-welfare/) nod their heads uncomfortably.

I cannot keep up. I live in a country that is one day ahead of U.S. time, but all news is one day old to me. *Voices from the past, in the future.* In the morning I open up my phone to find out what fresh hell the new administration has done.

I was listening to a podcast that called the chaotic spiral the U.S. is in **abuse**. At first, I thought the comparison was extreme — but then I started to think about what shape abuse takes and what it means to be a victim.

In a legal sense, the act of violence on someone is the one that is prosecuted. But the perpetual, generational violence that is the curse for the victims' and their children, and their childrens' childrens' to unravel is trusting that they are *safe now* and *have the agency to stand up for themselves* in a world that has both safety and danger. How *could* they when every night they stood by the door wondering what person would walk in the room? Their sweet and loving father or a monster?

But for a victim who has experienced abuse at the hands of a partner or family member, it can take *decades* to trust again. Sometimes they compartmentalize the abuse and become the abuser. *See how they like it when **they** have to live in fear like I did.*

Tucker Carlson's uncomfortably breathless promise of, "America's been a bad girl, and we're going to get a vigorous spanking," but it conjures up the exultation a younger brother feels when their older sister gets the belt and not them. *So glad it's not me.* This kind of talk - beating children, using the belt, instilling the "fear of God" — was normal while I was growing up. Was it normal in yours, too?

When I moved away from the U.S. I had a conversation with one of my coworkers that made me reframe my own experiences as an American. He asked me if all Americans owned guns. "Of course we don't all own guns," I said. "In fact, I don't like guns."

"How much gun violence have you personally seen?"

"Only two incidents," I said, feeling somewhat proud. "My neighbor shot himself, and I've been in an ER where someone came in with a gunshot wound." That of course, didn't count the countless videos I'd seen of police brutality, graphic depictions of war victims and assassinations on social media. "Not all that much. It's not like I was in a school with a shooter or anything. Why? How much have you seen?"

He went silent. I was confused until he said,

"I...never want to see those things. Ever. In my life."

*"Oh."*

What was I even thinking? *"Only two??"* I had unintentionally dismissed two, quite frankly, traumatic incidents that had happened as if it was normal. It's not unlike the dismissal of help from worried friends.

*Most days he's very sweet,*

*It's not really that bad. I'm tough!*

*I mean, every couple has a little fight now and then.*

It's taken me years to identify and re-wire my own anxious American brain so that I can be a functioning member of society - not one that is constantly on edge, defensive and paranoid. And I moved away in 2017.

Because I live in a country with gun regulations and don't experience the threat of gun violence anymore, I no longer can watch American action movies and shows. Movies before 2020 are typically fine, but the new releases scare me. The gore of someone's head getting bashed in or a close-up of someone being shot is so normalized in modern film it sends a chill down my spine - it's not just the act of violence itself but how explicit and casually as if this happens frequently in this fantasy world. As if we can't dream of a world without meaningless violence.

And I am reminded of this every day when I open the news. It is a hidden abuse that was done to me — and to all of us — that it is *normal* to live in this way. That to live in a country with liberty, we must give up our liberty to feel safe and supported. And we have been living in fear, I believe, for a long time. To my friends still living in the U.S. and who are afraid - consider this your validation. *It is not normal for you to live like this.* It was never normal to live like this.

Chaos' purpose is to keep the people involved unable to take clear actions. After all, what use is doing something if everything will change tomorrow? It keeps people stuck in fear. If I reframed this chaos as abuse, I wonder what I'd tell someone who was a victim. What would be the most compassionate thing to say? Certainly not the rhetoric of 2016 — *just ignore it and move on.* But urging us to be hyper-vigilant will only lead to exhaustion and more focus on *the abuser,* and not our own needs for safety, comfort and liberty.

Perhaps this: a reminder that what you are experiencing is not normal. You can understand why it happens, but it is not right, nor is it just. You deserve better than this. I am sorry. I do not expect you to announce what you'll do to fight back. In fact, I'd recommend against it. I won't judge you for "doing nothing" on the surface. Surviving can mean saving money. It could mean standing up and screaming back (for God's sake, stay safe). It could mean extending kindness and resources to others in similar situations and giving them hope. It could mean leaving and starting over.

Whatever it may be, do it for yourself. If you can't muster care for yourself, do it for those around you. And believe that there is a kinder, less fearful world out there for you.
