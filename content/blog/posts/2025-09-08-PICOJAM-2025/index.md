Thank you for your patience while I wrote up this after-report—August was busy!

PICOJAM was a PICO-8 only hackathon (also known as a game jam) held at Pico Pico Café in Kichijoji from Aug. 9th-10th this year. Our jam themes were 「溶ける」or MELT, and 「祭り」or MATSURI. We had ten participants and made six games and two free PICO-8 asset packs, one for pixel art and another for music.

Thank you to zep for having us at the Pico Pico Café, and a huge thank you to everyone who participated! 🎆

## What is PICO-8?

PICO-8 is a fantasy console that is for making, sharing and playing tiny games. Games are in 8-bit 2D and the engine includes a code editor, a sprite maker, a map editor, and a music/SFX maker all in one. It’s based in Lua and has a forum of sweet and dedicated fans. Notably, Matt Thorston and Noel Berry’s [Celeste](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=2145) and shoma’s [MOTION REC](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=53392) were originally made in PICO-8.

There’s a lot of reasons why PICO-8 is fun to develop in; it has so many design constraints that a lot of decisions are already made for you. Open Unreal Engine and you may marvel at the switches for hours—but in PICO-8 you can start making a game the moment it boots up.

## How did PICOJAM happen?

I was originally introduced to PICO-8 while organizing Global Game Jam (GGJ). I’m a fan of engines that have very low “start up cost” like Twine and Bitsy, since I prototype game mechanics quick and dirty first, and then build from that. After I made my first game in it, I was sold.

Some time later, I happened to run into another PICO-8 fan, [uchuzine](https://x.com/uchuzine), and he invited me to a regular meetup where PICO-8 fans would show off the games we made and chat over dinner. Naturally, being indie devs our work is very solitary, so we wondered—how about we do a weekend hackathon? And what better time to do it than August, a month where we’d all rather be inside, anyway?

I helped organize and run it; and it was a blast.

mabbees made a lot of music for this jam—he has a [more in-depth blog post about his process here.](https://mabbees.neocities.org/posts/016-picojam-2025/) He released the songs he made in a free asset pack you can use for your Matsuri-themed PICO-8 games—or other engines of choice.

I didn't have a lot of mental space to contribute, being the organizer, but at the final hour I thought—*dammit, I want to make something fun* and ended up making a huge free asset pack with 8-bit jams and matsuri foods—get it? for *jams haha.*

Feel free to use them in your non-commercial projects!

## Let's do it again!

I was really happy with the jam overall. People had fun, made a ton of creative games, and made new connections. It's the kind of space I look to create; where people feel comfortable and vulnerable and silly enough to play around and make new connections.

I've been itching to make a series of posts—or a zine even—about running game jams specifically in Tokyo. I've learned a lot about organizing in a place where venue space is at a premium, how to connect people who wouldn't otherwise talk with each other together and how to mix languages without solely relying on English. I wonder if anyone would be interested in something like that?

Thank you again to everyone who participated! It was fun, and I'm excited to do something like that again.
