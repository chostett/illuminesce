One of the most challenging parts of an organizer's job is navigating conflict and harassment at our events and in our communities. As an organizer in creative spaces for fifteen years in both the US and Japan, I propose both a framework to help navigate these challenges and as a "call in" for community members to take accountability for their own, and the community's growth.

It is intended to be used as a compassionate, but firm, way of establishing community guidelines in a diverse space and the more specific version of the broader rule of, "don't be a dick" or "be excellent to each other." It is taken from both nonviolent communication and transformative justice frameworks around "calling in" as opposed to calling out. References will be provided below.

The framework isn't perfect; it is an attempt to combat issues of both conflict and harassment in queer community spaces *and in addition* the chilling of community spaces to newcomers - essentially, those who don't posess the social clout yet to understand a communities rules.

It is about encouraging the unspoken to be spoken.

For lack of a better name, it is called "2-2-2," short for **2 guidelines**, **2 strikes** and **2 consequences**.

Thank you to orgs like Firecracker, Tokyo Pride House, Tokyo Rainbow Toastmasters, CitrusCon, and Boba Board - I learned a lot volunteering and working in and around you.

Huge thanks to D'Artagnian, GM Gray, Citizen, Madoka, Asuka, Mika, Dorota, Yukino, Niklas, Agnes, Honami, mabbees, Josiah and Ryan - everyone who has co-led with me in some capacity. There's no way I could do this alone. Your ideas, suggestions and gentle shoves are woven throughout.

So why is a framework like 2-2-2 necessary? The issue is twofold:

1. Most organizers are tired and susceptible to mistakes

2. Niche communities can either swing from overly permissive of shitty/abusive behaviors OR rely on unspoken "vibe-based" moderation

I argue that being both overly permissive or vibe-based moderation  leaves a community that doesn't know the boundaries of interaction. Thus, this leads to a community that normalizes being a mono-culture and lacks the ability to support diverse and marginalized voices.

### The problem: most organizers are tired

When I started organizing, I was not particularly skilled at communication or de-escalation. I was a zinester, a game dev, a designer who wanted to find people who shared my similar interests. I simply wanted this space to exist.

However, to *get* that space to exist, I had to learn a few things:

- how to find a venue

- how to promote so people will come

- how to find sponsors for events that cost money

- how to psych myself up to be extroverted in small bursts

None of these prepared me for my first experience with conflict. It was simply not on my radar. At first, I handled it poorly. Over time, I got a bit better. Each time was exhausting and anxiety-inducing.

So, nerd that I am, I read books. I bounced ideas off my co-organizers and friends and they came back with new frames of reference. I learned about non-violent communication. I mapped out my own privileges so I could better understand and serve people who came from different backgrounds than me. I practiced a *lot* in my communities. Over time, people around me began to remark that I was good at handling interpersonal conflict, so naturally, they asked me to mediate and make decisions.

I should have been more aware how exhausting this would be given my part experiences, but people pleaser habits die hard. I said yes. I took on more than my fair share of the mental load and ultimately burned out.

One night after a particularly harrowing incident, I remember thinking, *I started this group to create, not to organize.* I had run into a former club member that I had removed from our group for making denigrating comments about women. He walked up to the café table where I was having coffee with a friend and, red-faced and mouth screwed up into rage, screamed that I was a terrible person and that I'd die alone. Then he stormed out.

All I wanted was a space to hang out with other people. Why was this the result?

If you're an organizer, you may be familiar with this question. We are seen as someone capable of doing *anything,* and yet, behind it all, we are so, so tired. We know the space we run is *good* and needs to exist, but some days can be so overwhelming we want to shut everything out.

### The problem: Missing Stairs and Vibe-Based Moderation

When I looked around at other niche groups, I often found similar traits in their organizers—they were the overwhelmed bottlenecks of the organization. In some organizations there were people known as [missing stairs](https://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/06/missing-stair.html)—those who had grown a whisper network around them and who put the community on edge. The organizer was either too overwhelmed or refused to ask for accountability or worse; the missing stair *was* the organizer.

These missing stairs ran the danger gamut from "I have a strange feeling about them and I can't put my finger on it..." to, "don't be alone in a room with this person for **any** reason."

When a particularly dangerous missing stair was on the organizing team, often they were someone who "helpfully" stepped in to help a tired team. There were many reasons why the missing stair would stay in the organization:

- The organizer was afraid of losing this person and becoming overwhelmed again and so wilfully ignored repeated requests for accountability

- The missing stair was contrite and kind when speaking to the organizer but a different person towards their victims

- The victims were afraid of being seen as a "troublemaker" or afraid of getting into a popularity war with the missing stair, so downplayed their fear or silently left

It's easy to say "take accountability" but commonly it was solely up to the organizer who may not be as motivated as others to define *what* that accountability looked like *for* the victim and confront the missing stair. So they would ignore the issue, hoping for it to go away, downplay it as "not a pressing priority" or put the work of reconciliation back on the victim.

The overall result of this is that the community is less friendly and welcoming; newcomers either become targets or worry about being targets. Anyone who has a history of past trauma is on edge in the group and eventually leaves; *and once the people who warn leave the community, there is no protection for new members.* In general, it becomes a place for sowing mistrust, not healing and creativity.

I saw too much of myself in this overworked and tired organizer. I feared that one day, if I continued on that path, I'd cultivate a group with missing stairs, too.

The other extreme of this is vibes-based moderation.

[As I covered in this response post on vibes-based moderation](/blog/posts/2024-06-04-On-Vibes-Based-Moderation/), I've noticed a theme of "banning based on vibes" in Discord communities as a catch-all for "you're technically not doing anything wrong but you're being annoying."

While on its surface it seems useful for that one person who is always toeing the line - sometimes maliciously - it runs on the basic premise that any new person is not to be trusted and might be a troll. That kind of general paranoia in communities ends up poisoning the group and can end up, at its best, a shy person hanging around in a community and then leaving when no one welcomes them or more senior members talk over them.

At its worst, it's witch hunts and call outs, which happened a few years ago [causing a trans rights protest in Tokyo to be cancelled.](http://localhost:8080/blog/posts/2023-11-16-Tokyo-Trans-March-2023/)

In both cases, an evaporation effect happens through [the spiral of silece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_of_silence); by the majority or members with clout being more encouraged to speak than other points of view or new members, the community becomes one that loses voices from different backgrounds and points of view and becomes an echo chamber.

In different ways, both of these types of communities are dangerous to newcomers and don't facilitate the communities we want - ones that are strong, compassionate and account for a plurality of views.

2-2-2 provides a guideline on behavior change that is intentionally communicated to prevent this kind of evaporation from happening as well as help community members resolve conflict and even harassment when it occurs.

## Introduction to 2-2-2

Initially, this framework was called the "one-strike rule" but the more I wrote about it, the more I realized there needed to be more conscious writing on the underlying mindset and guidelines - calling it "one-strike" made it seem too simple when the decision to ban or remove someone is never an easy choice.

2-2-2 is a collection of three parts: **mindset, strikes, and consequences.** In this case "consequences" means simply "the result of one's actions." Everyone in the group is an adult and while they may have emotional reactions or thoughts that pop up, everyone has agency to control or change their behavior.

First, there are two important mindset that I try to proactively communicate and follow in the groups that I run. These serve as the foundation for 2-2-2.

### Mindset 1: Act Like You Live Here

It is not only the responsibility of the organizer, but each community member to ensure the space is inclusive long-term. If they see a behavior that's not in line with the space's principles, encourage them to call it in and request change. Usually a space has *some* principles, though applying this mindset may also help the community get more clarity.

For instance, if the space's principles are:

- to include different, diverse perspectives

- to feel comfortable making creative work

- to make new friends

If a community member witnesses someone making over-generalizations about a race of people, this goes against the space's principle of inclusion of different and diverse perspectives. Even if it's not directly involved with them, encourage them to speak up.

After all, you live in this space. And on a broader scale, this space doesn't exist in a vacuum. Take care of it and the people in it.

### Mindset 2: You are not your mistakes

Perhaps you too, have a voice in the back of your head judging you for your mistakes. Whiffing an interaction or not getting the response you expected can cause you to wonder if you're a bad person, or stupid, or "just don't fit" in the space.

[Self-Compassion](https://self-compassion.org/books-by-kristin-neff/) by Kristin Neff personally helped me a lot with this. Our actions, while in our control, are not our identity. We can still be good people and unintentionally make someone uncomfortable. A good example of this is when someone does or says something that is racist and disrespectful (i.e. touching a black person's hair without their permission "just out of curiosity") and, when asked to stop, responds, "But I'm not racist!"

But the actions they did were racist. "I'm not racist" is a rejection of an identity, but not accountability for one's actions. Most of us aspire not to "be a racist" but that doesn't change that we have the potential to hurt others through our ignorance, negligence or defensiveness. Not taking accountability gets in the way of us changing for the better.

Once I learned to separate myself, the person, who was deserving of love and kindness, and my actions, which sometimes were in alignment with the person I wanted to be and sometimes weren't in alignment, I had a much easier time changing my behavior. Feedback, especially in the form of "that was racist" or "that was classist" wasn't easy to hear, but it was also critical to helping me see things I either couldn't or wouldn't see alone.

To organizers - being an example of this in our communities where we both communicate our needs and foster an atmosphere of continual growth and curiosity is one of the strongest ways we can encourage others to do the same.

### On leading by example

I'm not saying leading by example is easy. It's *fucking hard.* It takes a balance of keeping ourselves accountable and trust; both of which aren't things that were readily modeled to us by others.

Both of these mindsets should be communicated and modeled to everyone *before* any conflict happens. Tell everyone you might not see everything, but you trust them as a group to resolve conflict, and if they cannot, to raise an issue.

For raising issues, give everyone the name of **at least two organizers** that can help with navigating conflict. This is to avoid one organizer becoming a bottleneck and reducing friction if an organizers turns out to be the person that the feedback is about. [[1]](#footnotes)

## The two strikes

In baseball, three strikes is an "out" — meaning the batter leaves the field if they miss the ball three times. Everyone in the community has two strikes per any incident. The **first strike** is the behavior that necessitates confrontation; the **second strike** is an observation of what happens when a person is confronted and asked to change.

Why not three? I find that if I wait for a third *incident* to occur, it has already affected the health of the community. I use the confrontation between myself and the other person as an indicator to see if they are open to change. If they are disengaged in changing their behavior, or lie to me and other organizers about changing their behavior, they aren't the right fit.

### First Strike: Clarification and envisioning accountability

How does this work in practice? When a claimant raises an issue, first thank them. You may want to ask clarification questions to get clear on the situation. For instance, I might ask the following:

- What actions or words were the issue?

- What actions did the claimant take, if any?

- Have they noticed a pattern, or is this the first time? Repeat the issue back to them to make sure you understand it properly.

By the way, the claimant can be you. It's important to self-assess *what* about the behavior was annoying or harmful before you approach someone about it.

Be aware that sometimes asking questions can be perceived as shifting responsibility back onto the claimant - we want to make sure that we are clear that this is to understand and assess the situation, and that if they are no longer comfortable dealing with someone, you are committed to help.

Next, assess the level of the claimant's emotion. You don't need to guess—ask them. Are they scared? Angry? Don't want to make a big deal out of it? Acknowledge this. You don't need to pry into the *why,* just that their emotions are valid. Ask them what accountability look like for them. What would be their desired outcome? What actions would need to be taken? [[2]](#footnotes) Depending on your level of friendliness with the claimant, you could provide suggestions, or workshop together. Let this be a dialogue you're actively participating in, not making the person carry the sole responsibility of solutioning. You may also want to involve other organizers here, with consent.

At this point, the claimant may feel comfortable re-engaging the other person themselves. You may also want, with the claimant's consent, to leverage your organizer powers to make a general announcement and reminder of the principles and mindset of the space. [[3]](#footnotes)

The important part of this step is to get clear on specifics with the intent of communicating it for behavior change. For instance, if a group of people is excluding a more inexperienced member, reminding everyone that all members, regardless of skill level, should feel welcomed in the space. Ask veteran members to check in on inexperienced ones to see what they need.

If the situation has high negative emotions or associated trauma, or the claimant *really* doesn't feel comfortable giving feedback, or directly asks you to step in, proceed to the Second Strike.

## Second Strike: Communicating and Observing

Once a desired outcome is established along with some suggested actions, ask for a 1x1 with the other party. Although it's a bit scarier, I find it helpful to do this step solo as it avoids the feeling of being ganged up on by other organizers. Let them know directly what actions and words were the issue. Remind them that they are not their mistakes and express the desired outcome and list some behavior changes that could contribute. Give them some space for them to process and respond. Listen carefully.

Depending on their maturity and willingness to engage with accountability, this will guide whether or not we decide to continue engaging or ask them to leave. We're not looking for a person to agree, capitulate, or pretend like they are sorry when they're not. This is also a dialogue, one that makes a request and asks what capacity the person has to fulfill that request. We may have given them suggested actions that, for whatever reason, they cannot take. What we *are* looking for is them genuinely engaging in dialogue with us.

After each of these steps, no matter what the outcome, they will end up in one of two consequences.

### If a person thanks me and starts a dialogue

This means the agree with the proposed outcome and are willing to engage in solutioning, even if the initial behavior is not one they are able to fulfill.

What engagement can look like:

- openly asking for clarity or specifics

- taking notes, taking some time to think

- them saying they can't commit to X behavior but they can commit to Y, as long as it both acheives the outcome and is okay for both parties

If we're *very* lucky, our first request will be one that they feel comfortable and able to take. But this is only in the very lucky situations. Dispute on the fairness of the outcome is covered below. If the behavior is one that is different than suggested, make sure to check in with the claimant. If both parties are okay, write down the commitment and commit to check back in. Remind them that they can enlist other community members to help keep them accountable.

### If the person tells you to go fuck yourself

They either don't agree with the proposed outcome or have shown no willingness to engage in dialogue. Ask them to leave the group immediately. I can accept that someone who is caught off guard can lash out in anger, but I refuse to allow myself or other organizers to be a verbal punching bag.

Should they be able to express their frustration or anger using "I" statements and without outright attacking, then, if you are comfortable, invite them to chat again 1x1 before they join again.

### If the person ignores you, avoids you or leaves you on read

Sometimes confrontation can be a lot to handle. Give them some time to engage and gently remind them again in a week or so. If they continue to ignore, they may not ready for the conversation.

This is a problem for an organizer since being left on read isn't engaging in any meaningful way or taking accountability, it's [stonewalling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewalling). If there is no communication about needing space and how much, it's hard to ask for behavior change. It is a total lack of willingness to communicate, and in couples, usually signifies the end of the relationship.

In this case, follow up with a message along the lines of, "I hope you know I don't think you're a bad person, if that's what you're thinking. I don't know." --> expand more here

### In the case of defensiveness

Sometimes the reception isn't that clear-cut and requires a bit more navigating. Oftentimes this happens when feedback triggers a defense response. It's normal to have a defense response to a situation one sees as threatening or tense and shouldn't be considered a mark of immaturity as long as the other person can work through it.

In my experience, there are two types of defensiveness.

#### Defensiveness with the person's identity at the center

As mentioned above, when one is confronted with their mistakes, sometimes the inner voices come out of the woodwork to blame. Listen kindly; sometimes people are trying to wrestle with the inner voices that are connecting their actions to their identity. I'll cover the types of behaviors you may encounter and the corresponding de-escalation strategy.

Behaviors include:

- Expressing regret that is outsized to the situation and goes into self-blaming (i.e. "I can't believe I did that; I consider myself an ally..." or "I really fucked that up. I'm such a fuckup.")

- Providing a long explanation as to why they did the things they did, but no acknowledgement of how they contributed to the situation (i.e. "Things have been really hard for me recently..." or "I struggle with social cues and when it's appropriate to touch other people...")

- Outright denial (i.e. "I'm not a racist," or "I'm not that kind of person")

If you encounter these, you may want to de-escalate by helping the person disconnect their sense of self from their actions. Repeat that they aren't their mistakes; perhaps give an example of your own.

Then ask again if they'd be willing to commit to changing these behaviors. They can even provide suggestions of their own, as long as it contributes to the outcome. Be kind but firm.

- If they say they will commit, thank them and tell them you look forward to it. Make sure to observe if their actions follow their words (Step 7). Remind them they can ask for help if they need it.

- If they say they will *try* but not commit, let them know kindly that commitment is not about succeeding 100%, it's about putting in a strong effort. Ask again for a commitment.

- If they refuse, ask them to leave. Usually a temporary ban will suffice; but if this is a repeat offense consider a permanent ban (Step 8).

#### Defensiveness by blaming others or denying the issue

I have a harder time finding compassion for people who blame others. I harshly judge this type of defensiveness in myself. However, defensiveness comes from the same emotional spring—fear. Handling blame with a logical approach is tricky, since you're being asked to verify facts that you may or may not have access to. You're not an all-seeing eye. Rather, let's respond to defensiveness with de-escalation. Something about the situation feels unsafe to the other person, and it would be wise to figure out what that is.

Behaviors include:

- Asking detailed questions on who made the claim, trying to call into question the claimant's reliability (i.e. "Who told you that?" or "You know (person's name) just switched their medications, right?")

- Making sweeping generalizations about other members or you (i.e. "I always get blamed for this kind of thing" or "I think you have it out for me")

- Outright denial (i.e. "that never happened")

If you encounter these, express surprise and curiosity. Remind them that their mistakes are not their identity. Encourage them to share from a more open heart and to refrain from using overgeneralizations: overgeneralizations and outward anger can get in the way of expressing vulnerability and prevent building meaningful connections with other people.

Heads up: even if you do ask people not to overgeneralize, be aware some organizers may encounter racist, sexist, transphobic, or ableist propaganda, sterotypes or generalizations couched as an "open heart" from the other person. This can exhaust a fair amount of energy to listen to compassionately and to educate. If you have the energy to educate, consider doing so, but remember that you do not have to. You can leave the conversation or ask the other person to consult a professional.

Their viewpoint could unearth some fear of not belonging or being rejected. If they were able to be more vulnerable, thank them.

Remind them that the community is a space built from everyone's effort to make it more welcoming. How can they make it more welcoming not only to the other person but to everyone overall?

The suggestions should be ones that are both mature and allows them to take accountability for resolving the situation. If they insist the issue will be resolved if they have alone time with another person to "work it out 1x1," refuse and prompt them with different suggestions. The issue isn't just about them and the other person; it is about the community as well.

If they suggest alternative actions that are both mature and allows them to take accountability to the community, *with the consent of both parties*, ask them to commit to those actions. Remind them that they can enlist other community members to help keep them accountable to their commitment.

If you cannot come to a resolution, you may have to ask them to leave.

---

## The two consequences

Regardless of the situation, there are two outcomes: one is to observe the situation and see if it improves, another is to ask the person to leave the group. What behavior change looks like should have been outlined in the previous steps, and there should have been verbal and written commitments made so you should have a good idea of what to look for when observing. This is done purposely to counteract "organizer brain" where once we've finished de-escalating a conflict we move on to something else and promptly neglect to monitor the situation.

Asking someone to leave isn't easy; in online spaces it manifests in a temporary or permanent ban with a click of a button, but for in-person events it may lead to asking the person not to come back or asking them to leave permanently. As with online and in-person; you can request a person to leave, but you cannot truly "ban" a person - they keep on existing in parallel to your space. This can be a deterrent to organizers who want to "keep the peace" in a small community; knowing that while the members may not have to directly interact with them, you may have to. In both consequences, I have some considerations and guidelines to keep in mind.

A typically unspoken, but important step in this process; *make sure that, as an organizer, you are taking care of yourself.* Being an organizer sometimes means you don't have others to vent or express your feelings to due to the risk of seeming to favor one side or the other. If I've had a bad day and I am in a situation where I have to ask someone to leave, I may not *feel* compassionate in the moment. Make space for these moments, even if it's in a personal diary or with the qualifier, "I need a place to vent..."

Own your actions and if you need something, give it to yourself or ask for it from your organizer team or a trusted friend if you're organizing solo.

### If they stay, hold them to their words

If we've done everything in the previous steps - communicated the two mindsets and followed the two strikes, then it should be clear to all parties what the desired outcome should be and as an organizer you can keep an eye out. In all honesty, I haven't had to put too much effort into this step except in one notable case; when feedback is spelled out compassionately and outcomes are made clear, I've pleasantly found that most people want to meet and exceed these expectations. I don't find time horizons to be helpful in feedback because it adds extra pressure to someone who may already be struggling to accept that they are a person who makes mistakes. I typically check back in with the claimant on the situation; they can give me feedback on how I handled it, as well.

In the case of a person committing to an action and not following through: I've been through this once before in fifteen years. Someone was contrite and committed to an action that they didn't believe in; they then later told me that since they didn't believe in it they didn't "really" commit and should be exempt. I have no patience for this kind of behavior. I asked them to leave and that they were not welcome back. Ironically, this was the same person from before who yelled I was a bad person and that I'd die alone. After I processed the initial personal shock, I was grateful that I'd asked him to leave.

I've never moderated a 1000+ Discord group before, so I can't speak to scalability - but this consequence seems difficult to scale and requires a personal touch. For this reason, I don't often find myself pursuing endless growth of the communities I organize; if I can get a few, high-quality people having high-quality interactions with each other, I consider this a success. Should others break off and form their own, smaller communities from mine, as long as there is still a friendliness and openness to communicate, this is also a success. I try to never grow past the organizing capability of the team; and if we do want to grow in people, I tell my community that to do that, we need more organizer support [4].

### If they cannot commit, ask them to leave

Someone telling me they will do something is much different than someone actually doing the action. Should I not see improvement, or a concentrated effort to reach out to community members to ask for help, then I'll ask them to leave temporarily to work it out on their own and then come back.

If this sounds harsh, consider: sometimes healing can be done within the community, and sometimes, healing is best done alone. Sometimes people don't have the presence or the energy to change in that moment. That's okay. But if that then becomes the obligation of the group to hold onto them until they choose to change it creates, again, a missing stair - one of a person who is not able to take accountability and also protect them from the consequences of their lack of accountability. When bans happen, if they are temporary I'll ask people to come back again after a few events; we stay in each others' circle.

I also like to perform some kind of ritual after I ask someone to leave - I never feel good doing causing someone distress, so I take some time to cool off and come down off an interaction. I may ask for a hug from a trusted friend, write in a journal or ask for some kind words. Doing some kind of ritual afterwards helps take the edge off confrontation and helps you caretake yourself as well.

Keeping track of these consequences requires organizer's notes and the information to be shared within the team. I tend to use Notion and other notepad apps to jot down quick notes for myself and a private Discord Chat to keep track of actions taken; sometimes this functions as a channel for discussion.

## In practice

How does 2-2-2 work in practice? Here an examples of a real situation where this was applied.

### Case 1: Finding a good space to vent

One of our participants was having a really shit couple of months. Recently she'd been coming to events and using any available opportunity to vent. At first, we were open to listening, but it had gotten so no other participant could speak without her mentioning something terrible. Prior to this, I had mentioned the 2 guidelines:  *act like you live here* and *you are not your mistakes* to the group.

One of the participants brought the issue up to me; they said they had come to the group to have fun and unwind and were starting to dread coming if she was going to be there. We both agreed the outcome in this situation was **maintining a positive atmosphere to unwind.** The first request they made was to "get her to stop," but I pushed back on this. Would her stopping actually solve the problem, or cause her to stuff her emotions in? They reconsidered and instead asked, "I'd like her to ask first before she vents."

Some potential behavior changes we workshopped were:

1. asking her to ask first before she vents

2. have a "venting time" for the first fifteen minutes of the club where everyone vents their frustrations and then keep the rest of the time for light talk

I went to her and asked her to do this; she readily agreed, admitting that she often forgot to check in with others. She committed to checking in with the group. The next time she asked everyone if it was okay if she could vent for a few minutes, and the group agreed. After she vented and got the comfort she needed, the conversation returned to its usual fare.

### Case 2: "Biological differences"

A participant and I hit it off through our event. I invited him out to coffee and he seemed pretty cool. I hadn't had time to mention the guidelines to him at that point.

Later, one of the participants in our event told me he'd been making misogynist and dismissive statements to other members, inserting himself into the conversation and telling them the reason they struggled with planning things was because "men and women are biologically different," implying that this meant women had trouble planning whereas men did not. They told him that he was a misogynist, and he defended himself, saying it wasn't his intent to harm. He never made these statements in front of me.

The participants brought the issue up to me, and I asked them what they wanted him to do; they clarified they wanted him to stop making gender essentialist comments, in particular reducing the complex gender landscape and nuance to biological differences that ultimately succumbed to old and overused stereotypes.

I told him in a one on one that I'd enjoyed our hangout together, and explained the guidelines of the club. I explained that a comment he made wasn't in line with the principles of our club, and he defended himself, asking me why I should insist on denying the truth that men and women were different?

I clarified that this wasn't about denying differences between men and women or other genders; this was about making broad generalizations of skill of a group of people based on stereotypes. I asked him if he could commit to questioning those stereotypes and not make broad generalizations in the future. Instead he explained again to me his rationale - it was not a vulnerable ownership of his own actions and how he came to this stereotype but rather a defense of his right to believe in gender essentialist theory. I listened for a bit, but found myself losing compassion for him as I realized the purpose of this conversation was to convince me of abdicating him from guideline 1: *acting like he lived* in the community.

I told him that it seemed that he wasn't ready to commit to either guideline of the club. I apologized for not informing him sooner, but he wasn't a good fit. He was welcome to come back after he'd taken accountability for his actions and didn't hide behind a belief of fake "logic" and "rationality," but that didn't fly here.

He later sent a harassing message to the participant who brought it up to me; I apologized for the distress caused and asked them to delete it immediately and inform me of any further contact with him/ He never came back to the group. The participant stayed in the group for a long time. I had to go through my own healing to forgive myself for allowing myself to get close to someone who was so shut down emotionally he'd rely on stereotypes to comfort himself. At first, I blamed myself for causing collateral damage to the other member; but then realized that was *him* who sent the message, not me. The best I could do is make sure that the group knew I was looking out for them and that this kind of behavior is unacceptable.

---

## In conclusion

After covering the steps and the use cases, I hope you can start see some ways in which you can use the two-strike rule in your organization. The framework itself is ever-evolving; and it relies not only on principles "act like you live here" and "you are not your mistakes," but also on mindset.

I can't stress enough the importance of, when you're an organizer, putting in checks and balances in your decision-making with a leadership team that has diverse perspectives. As someone who is nonbinary, it is much easier for me to see when someone crosses the line when they make gendered stereotypes and overgeneralizations; as a white native Engish speaker, I am less likely to notice when someone crosses the line when it comes to race, nationality and English ability.

Because of this, I read books by authors of color, find examples of common stereotypes as I hone my own intuition. Having someone else who has their own intuition is a huge help with moderating discussions with members with intersectional identities (for instance, someone who is transgender masc and neurodivergent and someone who is a queer femme black woman).

## Footnotes

[1] These two organizers also should not be married, dating or in a relationship together.

[2] In the case in which someone wants the resulting outcome to be immediate punative action or to call out and silence another person: ask them how this will improve their lives or the group as a whole. There are cases where the correct action will be to remove the person immediately from the group (covered in the following), but before we get to that point, we want to understand what accountability looks like for this person.

[3] Don't make a general announcement if the person raising the issue does not give consent. Taking a conflict between two people and make a general announcement of it can not only discourage people coming to you for future issues, but also encourage retaliation by others if the person raising the issue doesn't have an equal social standing with them.

This is a short introduction into what those parts do.
