While going through my cohost archive, I found this reply post that delved into some of community moderation. I ported it here for posterity, quoting the original poster [sasuraiger](https://bsky.app/profile/sasuraiger.bsky.social) here.

![Text of a Discord reads: alix: Got banned from 28's discord for saying this Imao (bad vibes arc) Feral: also removing someone  based on "vibes" and not something they did or said is not a good look Imao Arch-Mage Barnhart: removing someone based on "vibes" and not something they did or said is not a good look mao Gallowbait: We don't care lmao](mod.webp)

Pretty recently, I had a conversation with a new person in a games group that went towards the kind of pain Discord servers can be and how it's nice to have one that isn't exploding in drama.

The guy said "Yeah, tell me about it. One time I was in this discord where they didn't like me so I just posted from my archive of medical gore pictures until they had to ban me."

I immediately realized I was talking to the wrong person, which I guess came through later that night when I went to the bathroom and the guy had everybody ditch, like a high school popularity prank. Thank god I'm old now.

_My response:_

From my experience moderating communities, at least trying to articulate why a person is being disruptive or frustrating to the group can go a long way to having and retaining neurodiverse members rather banning them based on vibes.

Like, yeah…some people have, with good reason, bad vibes (like the above guy), but there’s other folks who for whatever reason come off as antisocial because they’re neurospicy but genuinely wish to be part of the community.

I ran a cartooning/zine making group for nine years, and neurodiverse/queer folks tend to be attracted to zines, as well as cis straight, neurotypical men who like comics in general. We had a one-strike rule: you get one strike to fix it, and if you don’t, you get kicked out. I have no tolerance for bad actors in groups.

This helped us determine pretty well who was acting in good faith or not. We had a few members who would overshare or try to push their work on other people…after I explained to them 1x1 that they were making folks uncomfortable because of the oversharing, they’d apologize to the group and _catch themselves the next time they did it._

These folks stayed in our little group and we amassed a TON of neurodiverse people this way. Sometimes people want quiet while others wanted to talk a lot, and these things happen when your brain pattern doesn’t match up with other people’s brain patterns.

Some other members however, would do the same thing and when I took them aside, they were defensive and angry. They would escalate the situation rather than de-escalate. If they gave me any indication they’d do the same behavior again, in 1x1, I’d tell them to leave immediately and ban them.

I’m not a fan of the “vibes based moderation” because it reads to me as using the excuse of bad actors to employ discriminatory practices without having the burden of having to externalize what your community values.
