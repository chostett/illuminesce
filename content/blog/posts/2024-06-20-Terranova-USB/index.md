Weâ€™re getting prepped for [Tokyo Sandbox](https://www.tokyosandbox.com/terranova), so it was time to make another round of these little guys.

We sell these 4GB USBs with:

- a full copy of Terranova (EN)
- the demo version of Terranova (JP)
- full res wallpaper packs

You can [see the previous versions here](/posts/2023-06-26-Terranova-USB.html) and purchase them on our [Ko-Fi shop](https://ko-fi.com/illuminesce) (limited supplies only).
