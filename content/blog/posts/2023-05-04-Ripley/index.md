There are times when you make mistakes and apologize.

Other times, you make mistakes and dig your heels in, despite you being entirely, blatantly wrong.

This is a story about one of those times.

My partner loves Metroid. Loves it. He has played all of the games.

I, however, attempted to play Metroid II when I was a kid on the Game Boy Color while in the passenger seat of a moving car. I was so frustrated by the game that I didn't realize I had motion sickness until my stomach forcibly expelled its contents onto me, the car seat, and the game.

That was the last time I played Metroid.

This means I have a vague, often incorrect memory of knowing what Metroid is about, and, in my attempts to support my partner, end up getting facts about Metroid wrong.

For instance, in Metroid Prime he was playing a part where Samus was followed by the pterodactyl alien monster and I saidâ€”

"Aw man, that Ripley is so scary."

"You mean Ridley?" he offered. This, I realized after the fact, was his way of allowing me a graceful out. I had gotten the name of the titular villain in Metroid wrong and he figured I was just misremembering.

Instead of admitting my mistake, I responded in hubris.

"No, it's...Ripley. It's definitely Ripley."

He squinted at me. "No, it's Ridley...like Ridley Scott, the director of _Alien_."

"No, Ripley is like...Sigourney Weaver's character in _Alien_, right?"

He stopped playing Metroid to open up a wiki. To which, I realized the following three things:

1. Its name is Ridley, not Ripley.
2. There's no way I could have "pulled a fast one" on a diehard Metroid fan with my limited knowledge (see: fifteen minutes in the car before vomiting) of the Metroid series
3. I have completely unearned confidence in my knowledge about Metroid AND in the movie _Alien_

Even after I learned these three things, I still kept saying, "but I could have sworn..." How did I get this knowledge that I felt so sure about? Why was I so convinced?

I have since openly admitted to my partner that I was wrong and he is the Most Knowledgeable Metroid Dude but from time to time he'll point at the screen when Ridley appears and go, "Look, it's your favorite character, Ripley!"

I admit, I still believe Ripley exists, around 20%. It's a feeling I can't shake. Maybe not in Metroid, but in some separate universe, there's a pterodactyl alien chasing the Famous Seamus Arran and she'll point her bean guns at it and say,

## "I'm coming for you, Ripley!!!!"
