![Rainbow USB keys with the word 'Terranova' printed on it.](./terranova-usb.png)

Our game, [Terranova is going to be at BitSummit!](https://bitsummit.org/en/game/terranova/) This is our first in-person event, so I wanted to make something special.

I hand-screenprinted these USB sticks that will have the game + a steam key included; excited to show off these colorful dudes. Printing on a 3.3cm surface was crazy difficult.

_Psst...[I did a reprint of these keys.](/blog/posts/2024-06-20-Terranova-USB/) You can purchase them on our [Ko-Fi shop](https://ko-fi.com/illuminesce) (limited supplies only)._

Terranova is a nostalgic, text-based [interface drama](/blog/posts/2023-08-22-Interface-Drama/) about fangirls in the early 2000's on _LimeJournal_. Available on PC, Mac and Linux [here](https://playterranova.com/).
