Recently I was listening to [NPR’s Code Switch](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/15/1197954284/palestinian-americans-on-erasure) where Palestinian-American poet Fady Joudah spoke about his own Palestinian-American identity in regards to the bombings in Gaza, and something he said struck a chord deep within me—

> “One of the things you learn about being Palestinian in English is that you’re constantly encountered through a lens of necropolitics—**you are only alive when you are dying**.”

It is a terrible thing to feel invisible only when you are suffering. The words sat in my gut for a while. Of course, I was guilty of this not just during the bombing of Gaza, but I was one of the many white people who went out and bought, “How to Be an Anti-Racist” after the murder of George Floyd. I was part of the collective who knew of Rodney King only as a line in a rap song.

When I heard this quote, I thought about this time of year, how it is Trans Day of Remembrance, and my first event in 2014, when I stood round with the community and read out the names of those of us who had been murdered in the past year. I biked home and I cried angry tears. How was it that this gathering, in one of the most LGBTQ+ friendly places in Texas, had seemingly no cis allies in the audience? Where were they with us to grieve the losses? Did they even know?

What are our identities outside of necropolitics? Outside of indifference?

Fady continues, _“For me, when I think about being Palestinian…it’s about eating delicious food, eating with your loved ones, staying up late and enjoying the breeze. Much of our identity is eclipsed by violence. But even if objects are destroyed, you still have people.”_

_“There’s a beautiful saying in Arabic… “the remainder is in your life.” And it is something you say to someone who has lost someone; their husband, their family, their partner. And then they will respond, “and in yours.” It is a saying that believes in the continuum of memory and the life force. What we [do in our writing] is sharing the remainder of the lives of those who have been lost.”_

Perhaps these words will reach your heart as they have mine.
