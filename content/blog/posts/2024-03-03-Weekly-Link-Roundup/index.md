Recently, my friend [**perroquadrado**](https://perroquadrado.neocities.org) and I have been sharing links for various RSS readers we've been using. He mentioned liking blog posts where authors post links of interesting articles they've read that week or month.

This week I've been on vacation and have been diving into not only the ocean, but also some interesting books and articles on romance and desire as I'm in the process of developing a romance game.

### Life and New Experiences

Interesting links from my RSS feed and new things. I'd love to try a a walk and talk someday.

* [Walk and Talk.](https://sive.rs/wt) Derek Sivers
  * Derek describes a recent experience he had at a "Walk and Talk," a 70km walk where the purpose is to talk to folks while walking and get to know them over the course of a week.

### On Desire and the Otome Game Genre

I'm developing a romance/otome game, and for research, have been delving into the nature of desire and the otome genre viewed from a feminist lens.

* [Eros, the Bittersweet.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150255.Eros_the_Bittersweet) Anne Carson, 1986.
  * A philosophical and linguistic look into Greek authors' original conception of Eros as desire. Heady, but filled with gems about the push and pull of romantic love in literature.
* [Pretty Boys All in A Row: Otome Games and Feminism.](https://otome.ch/2018/06/12/otome-games-and-feminism/)
* [To Each Their Own: Reclaiming the Japanese Otome Genre as Empowering in the West through LudoConsent.](https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/425036) Tina N Howard, 2023.

### Japanese Novels/Comics | 日本語の小説・漫画

I also practice Japanese regularly by picking up new and old novels and comics to read.

* [走れメロス. 太宰治.](https://www.aozora.gr.jp/cards/000035/files/1567_14913.html)
  * A short story by Osamu Dazai. I'd read 人間失格, or No Longer Human, and I liked it. Hadn't heard about this one.
* [ボール・アンド・チェイン | Ball and Chain. 南Q太.](https://shuro.world/episode/826/)
  * A manga about a married nonbinary person coming out and finding themselves. Written by an out nonbinary person.

Hope you enjoy these links as much as I did.
