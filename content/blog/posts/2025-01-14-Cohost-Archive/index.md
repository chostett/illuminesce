From November 2022 - September 2024 I posted regularly on an alternative social media site called cohost. As of this year it has since closed down. I took some time over the past couple of months to port some of my favorite cohost posts here.

Here's a few of my favorites:

## Longchosts

I posted a lot about fandom during those years. It was a good space to do "longchosts," or long, rambling posts about a single topic which I took advantage of.

* [Let's talk about Shadow Hearts](/blog/posts/2023-07-03-Lets-talk-about-Shadow-Hearts/): the history of one of my favorite games of the bygone PS2 era, _Shadow Hearts_ and its predecessor, _Koudelka_.
* [I've been getting into a shoujo manga called Cipher](/blog/posts/2023-12-11-Cipher/): now with new screenshots of the manga. I read a shoujo manga called Cipher from the 1980's and write about how impressive the heavy subject matter was for the time.
* [As a longtime dollfie fan](/blog/posts/2023-08-30-As-a-longtime-dollfie-fan/): in response to あれく's blog post on the ball-jointed doll fandom.

## Interface Dramas

It also was the place where I started thinking critically about interface dramas, with the input of other cohost members:

* [The Genre of Interface Dramas, Fiction, Visual Novels and Epistolary Games](/blog/posts/2023-08-22-Interface-Drama/): An archived thread of discussion about interface drama as a genre, with other overlapping and constrasting types. Rastagong's post is reposted with permission.
* [Indie Games of Cohost: CJ from Studio Terranova](/blog/posts/2024-05-18-Indie-Games-of-Cohost/): An interview by Kyle Labriola of Indie Games of Cohost. Reposted with the author's permission.

## Cohost Summer Mixtape

A fun little compilation of different people's song recommendations for the summer of 2023. Contains some downloadable mixtapes as well as embedded links to songs.

There's a lot more than just that, though. You can check out all of [the Cohost tagged posts here.](/tags/cohost/)

This archiving project was a labor of love and a more long-term commitment to posting regularly on my blog. I've come to enjoy blogging here and following folks on RSS. 

You can [follow me here](https://illuminesce.net/rss.xml)—all I ask is that you drop some of your own recommendations (your blog included) in the comments below. Thanks!
