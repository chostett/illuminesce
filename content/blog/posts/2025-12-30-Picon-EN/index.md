[Picotachi 78](https://bsky.app/profile/picopicocafe.bsky.social/post/3m7tudupsec2x) was the final Picotachi of 2025. Picotachi is a monthly meetup of game creators, artists and musicians that share their process and work in progress in short, five-minute talks. 

Initially, the meetup was born from fans of the fantasy console [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) and consisted of projects from there, but it attracts pixel artists, retro developers and artists. This year, Pico Pico Café reopened, and with it, the chance to connect with other game devs. As much as I can, I try to participate in Picotachi events.

Below is the English translation of the short talk I gave at Picotachi 78.

I'm known in the local Tokyo gamedev scene mostly as a game developer and organizer of Global Game Jam, but I want to show folks a different side of me. I started blowing glass in 2020, and have evolved my art into making sculptures. I'll be giving this talk "devlog-style" - except I won't be talking about a game, I'll be talking about sculpting in glass.

At last month's Picotachi, the owner of Pico Pico Café introduced a "new design" of her character for the café, Picon. (The original character had a tail, but this Picon is tail-less.)

I was so charmed when I saw her new design. So cute!

There wasn't a terribly deep reason for making Picon in glass, mostly that I thought it would be fun and make its creator happy - who doesn't love fanart of their OC?

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/XOgAqD_xaS-1920.png" alt="A diagram of Picon, broken into three parts. Text: It's important to consider the order of operations in glass.">

From what I've learned in trying out different forms, in glass sculpture the most important thing to pay attention to is the order in which you make each of the parts. That's why when designing the glass piece I sketched out Picon and divided them into three parts, the head, the middle, and the feet.

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/y4kUuVLvG1-1920.png" alt="A diagram of Picon and below it, a diagram of glass coming out of the oven. Text: Make bubbles on the piece.">

There's not a lot of folks out there who have done glassblowing before, so it's a bit hard to visualize if I describe the process solely in words. That's why I've drawn out the process on each of these slides.

First, I made the bubbles in the piece by sprinkling baking soda on hot glass. I take glass out of the furnace at about 1000 degrees Celsius, put a little baking soda on it, and take another glass pull. The glass is constantly rotating on a steel or aluminum pole called a blowpipe.

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/FmyhdSmmKk-1920.png" alt="Text: But wait...shouldn't the head be first?">

First, I make the middle part of the sculpture.

"Wait...why the middle?" you might ask. In general, when we think about focal points for sculpture, it's the head first, right?

**Actually!**

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/Ija8VINXTt-1920.png" alt="Text: Actually, I start from the feet!">

If we flip our thinking around, the tip of the blowpipe is actually the head, and the tip of the ball of glass will become the feet. The middle part, as opposed to the head and feet, is the hardest to heat, so I started with that first.

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/CPTt2u748_-1920.png" alt="A diagram of a furnace. The front of the furnace is colder than the back. Text: We create the middle.">

If I were to show you a bird's eye view of the furnace, you'd see that the front of the furnace is colder than the back. This means it's easier to reheat the feet than the middle. I start with the middle and then work my way back to the feet. 

We'll get to the head later.

**I see!**

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/nIhzPgAFYW-1920.png" alt="With pincers, I pull out the arms and legs one by one.">

Hot glass cannot be touched directly, so I use steel pincers to pull out the arms and legs and shape them. 

This is also how I make the "tail" nubbin and legs. 

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/szVh5iGhCn-1920.png" alt="A person looking very seriously at a glass sculpture while turning a blowpipe in their hands. Text: Actually, this was the most difficult part.">

In truth...this part was the hardest. It may not look like it in the finished piece, but I struggled a lot with the legs. ._.

Why?

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/0vbiIwMMMz-1920.png" alt="Standing Picon. Text: Picon doesn't have a tail, so it's much easier for it to fall over and break.">

Another important consideration in creating sculptures is the structural stability of the piece. Picon, as I mentioned before, went from having a tail, which would ground it at three points (leg, leg, tail) to only two points (leg, leg). This means that the piece can easily fall over and break.

 I said I wanted to challenge myself, and this definitely was a challenge!

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/tjXWuYAFcP-1920.png" alt="Standing Picon and sitting Picon. Text: Safe!">

In the end, I gave up on Picon standing on two legs and made the snap decision to have them sit down.

<img src="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-12-30-Picon-JP/Cf2YDNu2CK-1920.png" alt="Text: And lastly, the head.">

Last was the head! I stuck another rod to Picon's base (or "butt") called the punty and broke it off the blowpipe so I could work on the head.

Just like the legs and "tail" of Picon, I pulled out the head slowly with pincers. When I pulled out the head from the form, it stretched a bit.

For the eyes, I used a long and thin piece of glass and fused it to the piece. Prior to making this piece, I did a "practice" piece where I fused about ten or so eyes to a glass ball just to make sure I didn't mess this up. 

(When drawing on glass, if you mess up you have to cut the glass off the piece, which can damage the face.)

I like drawing on glass with glass, so this was the funnest part for me! (laughs)

Especially when a glass piece has a face, it really gives it personality, don't you think?

Because it's December and I didn't want Picon to catch a cold, I made them a scarf.

So, what do you think? Were you able to visualize my process?

If you're interested in learning more about glassblowing, [I made a game in English and Japanese about the fundamentals of glassblowing called Keep Center.](https://illuminesce.itch.io/keep-center) Please take a look! 

Thanks for listening, and I hope it sparked an interest in glass art.

See you next time!
