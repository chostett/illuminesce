To recap, [in part one of **How Do We Share Power Dynamically?**](/blog/posts/2025-06-20-Sociocracy-Pt1/) I spoke about the cognitive dissonance between what the tech world promised versus what we actually built behind the scenes, discovering sociocracy through fandom, and why we wanted to try out this framework.

Part two is about how we implemented sociocracy in our organization and my own thoughts and learnings from that process.

Back to our retreat in Yamanashi.

It's a brisk day for early June, and mabbees and I have picked our facilitator Heather, up at the local train station. After some pre-reading of the sociocracy manual [Many Voices, One Song,](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/many-voices-one-song-2/) we dive into the first part of the day—recapping the mindset of sociocracy and defining our vision, mission and aims with the goal of developing our circles and roles afterwards.

## The mindset of sociocracy

Sociocracy sees power like water. Power is itself neither good nor bad. What matters is how it’s wielded. When it’s channeled to flow equitably, it can give a voice to all members of an organization. When hoarded, it becomes stagnant. The goal in sociocracy is to share power in a way that’s effective and consensual.

It is different than [founder mode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder_mode), which argues that by ceding all power to the founder, decisions will be made quickly. It is also different than [design by committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_by_committee), which lacks clarity and direction. A key principle is equivalence—decisions may be made by a few, but it is designed to elicit feedback from everyone affected by the decision. Sociocracy aims to find balance between effective decision making and organizational sustainability.

## The organizational structure of sociocracy: circles

[Sociocracy](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/sociocracy/) is run in circles, which can also be called groups or bubbles. Membership in circles is consent-based; all members must consent to being part of the circle. How many aims an organization has will usually determine how many circles it has. Circles are dynamic. They can fluctuate over time, and if the aim is no longer necessary, they may dissolve.

As our studio does both client work and games, we created five circles to encompass each broad area of responsibility.

Below are our circle names and aims:

[image]

- **General Studio Terranova Circle:** Ensuring our strategies align with our vision
- **Client Work Circle:** Providing high-quality bilingual services (user research, interaction design, UI programming) in Japan on a hybrid/full remote basis
- **Games Circle:** Creating queer narrative games for the joyfully alt
- **Community Circle:** Building a community of people interested in a cooperative, queered future
- **Operations Circle:** Ensuring overall financial health of Studio Terranova

I’m putting this up here as an example of what our organization looks like on the inside. We’ll get more into *how* we defined these aims in the next section.

## Vision guides the spirit, aims guide the work

Have you ever been in or facilitated a workshop whose main goal was defining the *product vision?* Also known as the “north star” in design, this is the “to-be” state of the world with your product in it.

In sociocracy, it is structured as, *“We are dreaming of a world where it is true that...”*

There’s a lot of dreams we had for the future state of the world, such as…

- technology works in favor of humans, not against them
- we feel optimistic about the future
- serving community is valued more than serving capital

Ultimately, we went with: *“We are dreaming of a world where it is true that serving community is valued more than serving capital,”* as our vision and, *“Our mission at Studio Terranova is to explore new frontiers in technology and games.”* Our reason was that, as a consultancy, we still wanted to do work and make games, but as a whole, if we could change the way we work to value accumulating community more than accumulating capital, we would not only change the way technology we built worked and would also feel more optimistic about the future.

I found that sociocracy’s method of generating a “to-be” state proved to be much more open ended about “how” that future state was achieved. I liked this because “we make a new product or service and people buy it” isn’t always the solution to a problem. Sometimes, it’s implementing policy or education or starting a community space. While all of these involve design and creation, they aren’t limited to physical or digital products. There are many roads to changing the future, and we need not assume that a product is necessary to change it.

It’s exciting to think big like this. But once we had our vision, only a fraction of our work was done. Now was the time to get our hands dirty of *how* we would go about building that future—the more specific, the better.

According to [Many Voices, One Song](https://www.sociocracyforall.org/many-voices-one-song-2/), aims should be defined as early in an organization’s life as possible and also be as specific as possible. A majority of conflicts arise in organizations due to everyone agreeing on a vision, but not agreeing on what the tactics are the organization should use to achieve that vision.

For instance:

> *If a group is planning to build a cohousing community in Toronto, it is helpful to narrow down where the community might be built. If some of the founding members can only live in the northern part of the city, while others cannot work with that, it is wiser to split up early and each group pursues their aim. How we answer these questions will change who our potential buyers are.*

So, how do we explore new frontiers in technology and games with the vision of serving community *being valued more* than serving capital in the world? It follows that we must practice what we preach—in what way do we value community? Who is our community for?

We created this aim:

- Building a community of people interested in a cooperative, queered future

In particular, we chose the word “queered” as a verb—as in “queering games”—something I first heard in reference to game developer [Robert Yang’s](https://factoryinternational.org/about/press/news/robert-yang-queering-gamer-culture-gardening-game/) work. It is not only in reference to the player character being queer, but having queer experiences be seen as “normal” from the viewpoint of everyone in the world.

> 'Discussions around activism, politics, the politics of statutes and the politics of the internet don't have to be terrible. They can be pleasurable.’

I don't think about this as an 'either-or' situation; I see this as a 'and, including' situation; both speaking up loudly for our rights *and* imagining queered futures will get us where we need to go. One for rejecting the status quo, the other for steering us towards a bright future. For this, we chose the aim:

- Creating queer narrative games for the joyfully alt

But we don’t *just* make queer games. The main part of our business is partnering with both for-profit, non-profit and government clients who care about how people will use their digital tools. We also work in both English and Japanese, and are based in Japan, so that should factor into our client work aims:

- Providing high-quality bilingual services (user research, interaction design, UI programming)  in Japan on a hybrid basis/full remote basis to organizations who care about how people will use their digital tools

This helps us laser focus on prioritizing those that want senior professionals who work with autonomy to help them with user research, design, and programming and who care about how their tools will be used. And finally, in order for our business to function, it must be financially healthy, pay its taxes in Japan and adhere to our vision. Thus the last aims:

- Ensuring overall financial health of Studio Terranova
- Ensuring our strategies align with our vision

These are the basis of our circles.

Writing down aims was difficult, even amongst the two of us. It required negotiation—*”are we sure we want to leave out that group?”*—*”maybe we should be less specific here since we don’t know the landscape yet and will revise”*—but ultimately, it was very useful. I would liken this work a bit to creating a [Business Model Canvas](https://www.strategyzer.com/library/the-business-model-canvas), but more open, since the Business Model Canvas is designed only to be used only within for-profit companies, which assumes a few critical things that don't necessarily have to be true.

This opened us up to consider things that were not typically “valued” in common for-profit businesses. Commonly in for-profit businesses "community" is something done to market—we are, in part, community-funded, but our community does not have to pay us to play in our space. Community is a way for us to give back and find like-minded people.

Our marketing sub-circle rests within the Operations Circle, whose aim is “ensuring overall financial health of Studio Terranova.” We purposefully treat marketing as daily operations; something necessary and important to our financial health, but not one that rests on “monetizing” our community.

In this way, or organizational structure at its core supports our vision of valuing community over capital.

## Domains—giving us the authority and autonomy to work

Sociocracy values circles having authority and agency to do work to serve their aim. How do we ensure this? By defining areas in which they have responsibility—that is—domains.

For example, take a website admin whose aim is “keep the website updated bi-weekly.” If they must ask someone else at the organization for a one-time password every time they need to log in, this stalls their work and makes it difficult for them to achieve their biweekly aim. Giving the web admin authority to manage the full login—one-time password and all—makes sense. The ***only*** reason to restrict this authority would be if another group needed co-authority for other aims. Restriction shouldn’t be done out of the desire to maintain control.

In the companies I’ve worked at before, talk was given about autonomy, or desiring workers who could work autonomously—but the company itself was organized as such to not give full authority to those who needed it. The two that immediately come to mind are limitations in software and limitations from leadership.

Limitations in software happen when software pricing isn’t flexibly structured and the team that purchases it has little operating budget. This can cause a team to share a single company login or for a team to send work to one person who “has the license” even though they could do it themselves if they had the software.

Limitations in leadership happen when the founder or leadership team, for reasons that can range from valid past experiences to paranoia, holds a belief that their fellow teammates don’t care about or want to know the organization deeply like they do—and so, have difficulty delegating or fully trusting people in a flat hierarchy.

Being a recovering “lone wolf” I understand this fear—putting authority in the hands of someone else requires vulnerability, making my thoughts visible in a way others can understand, and willingness to accept the consequences that occur. The answer I’ve found in sociocracy to allay these fears is objection and consent. All circles have the authority to consent to who they work with. Circles that deal with sensitive information may raise an objection or ask the person to work as a “shadow” to a role with login access before doing the role themselves. On the other side, the person has the ability to consent or object to the terms offered them, and if they object, can make a counter-proposal until an agreement is made.

I’m not saying this is easy. But I’d rather build a community with members I can trust and rely on than one where I am the sole authority who wastes away from burnout.

For example, let’s take the **Community Circle,** whose aim is **to build a community of people interested in a cooperative, queered future.**

[image]

We have a Studio Terranova Discord Community, a Let’s Games! Tokyo Discord that I run as a volunteer, and I regularly keep in touch with our clients via coffee. So for the Community Circle, our domain is:

- Studio Terranova Discord
- Let’s Games! Tokyo Discord
- Volunteer Management
- Accepts Bug Reports and Player Feedback for Games (Steam, [itch.io](http://itch.io) and Discord) and sends them to Games Circle
- Client Coffees

These are the things we have full authority to act on. I wanted to point out Bug Reports, as the Community Circle is the circle that is player-facing, but they have a handoff with the Games Circle, who have the programming and design expertise to fix the bugs.

An important part about defining domains is clarity and specificity. To take a quote from the Sociocracy Handbook “Many Voices, One Song:”

> *If there is overlap in the domains of two given circles, the circles might step on each other’s toes. How do we notice if they do? Every time there is an argument following one of the patterns below, then we know there is an overlap between domains or a lack of education on what domains are.*

> *"Why did they do….even when we already did? Why did they change our…? Why aren’t they taking care of….? Why don’t they ever….? Do they not know they should…?"*

> *The simple answer might be: “because there was not enough clarity on how the domains were defined. In both cases, there might we feelings stirred up. The most constructive response, however, is curiosity: “I wonder whether our domains are defined well enough.”*

[image from p 26]

Going back to the domain on bug reports—there is possibility that the handover process will be a source of conflict. What if the bug is critical but we lack the resources? What if the Games Circle fixes some bugs and doesn’t report to the Community Circle, so they keep sending them the same report, over and over? Although these are things that *may* occur, we have a *safe enough to try* framework for reporting bugs, and as we understand the space, so too will our domains adjust until we’ve found a perfect groove.

I enjoy this kind of “organizational shaping”—that is, building in enough structure for people to move autonomously but not so much structure that they are too restricted—because it allows us to shape to the level of flexibility or rigidity our company can safely try. Just like living organisms, organizations can come in all shapes and sizes and level of tolerance.

Once we had our domains defined to the point where we felt comfortable trying them, we moved on to roles.

## Roles

Defining roles proved to be one of the most eye-opening experiences for me that week. Studio Terranova, at present, is two people. The blessing and the curse of being only two people is that our time and energy is limited and so, we must use it wisely. When we first started the company, we had a shared vision, but this is not enough to prevent burnout—in fact, the more passionate we are about our work, the more likelihood we had to overwork ourselves. One main goal figure out *what* we were doing so that we could *delegate* or *drop* some of the things we were doing.

Unlike an LLC in the US, which is essentially a name that one can do business under, LLCs or 合同会社 in Japan require tax reporting and payments several times a year, accounting, and employment of a tax adviser. This is a downside if you’re running a small business in terms of money and time, but it is a benefit if you’re doing client work and selling things in Japan—there is a lot more trust and legal benefits for a properly formed business than 個人授業, an individual proprietorship.

We were both full-time workers who made video games on our nights and weekends, who, in 2024, transitioned to contract workers who did bugfixes and marketing for the video games they had already made on nights and weekends AND went to the tax office on our lunch breaks. No time to explore new projects or to think about breaks. By our retreat, we were *exhausted*.

The first step to understanding how overworked we were was to lay our cards out on the table. First, we assigned ourselves to a particular circle, and brainstormed the pre-existing roles we’d already been doing or, more realistically—had been doing half-assed as we were doing everything.

[image]

The results were humbling.

I had been doing 29 out of the 34 roles on this board, a majority of them solo.

No wonder I had no time to brainstorm new ideas or make games. Some strong feelings came up for me—confusion (how did it get so bad?), resentment (why am I doing this alone?), apprehension (will this time be different?) and relief. I had brought up these feelings in the past, but didn’t have the headspace to clarify what roles were being done and what knowledge was needed to do them.

We discovered there were a few reasons for the imbalance:

- one of us was more technically skilled to do a job (i.e. coding, design or knowledge of Japanese)
- no skill sharing on around how to do a role (i.e. “CJ knows how to do the role better so I’ll leave it to them”)
- no clear domain or process of consent around picking roles (i.e. not sure what “marketing” entails or things need to be done, but it is undecided by whom)

We went through each role and went through a process of consent, deciding our roles and the term length. Some of the roles we picked up joyfully; others required more careful consideration into what sociocracy calls our Zone of Tolerance.

We all have specific individual preferences; finding collaboration solely within our zone of preferences will end up in some gaps roles either being undone, and as a result, our aims not being completely achieved. Sociocracy focuses more on our zone of tolerance; the area in which we think something is “safe enough to try.” This could be:

- Something we’re not good at, but don’t see the harm in failing
- Something we are okay doing for a short period of time
- Something that, if the responsibilities were slightly different, we would be okay taking

All of these are outside of our preferences, but allow us to enter into a dialogue about what parts of the role we object to, and how we can shape it so that it still achieves our ultimate aim. For instance, if our aim is to run a bakery and we don’t like getting up early, we can either opt for a role that doesn’t require us to get up early, be okay with getting up early for a short period of time, or figure out another way of baking that doesn’t require getting up early—perhaps a midnight shift, provided our team consents to this shaping as well.

This kind of consent shaping was, outside of my partners, the first time I’d had critical, compassionate conversations about where my zone of tolerance began and ended as well as fitting roles in a way that both served the organization and us as human beings with needs.

We also determined that there needed to be someone that we hired to fill some roles I was filling solo—in particular, a paid apprentice who can:

- help us post on social media regularly about our upcoming games, work and newsletters in English and Japanese
- can assist CJ in making graphics, GIFs and videos for marketing
- can help us apply for in-person events and keep on top of submission deadlines
- can help us manage our Steam and [itch.io](http://itch.io) bug reports
- is interested in learning about making games

This, in sociocracy is called an operational role—someone who is hired to do a specific set of roles rather than a member in a bubble. We call it an apprentice position because we’re willing to put in some time and energy to help this person grow—having 5 years of prior experience is not only an unreasonable expectation but one that places the onus on the apprentice to solo-learn, rather than co-learn.

We’re still shaping what our budget would look like for hiring this person and for how many hours a week (likely this will be a part-time position), but through the process of defining our roles we now have a very clear idea of what we need help with and what the domain of this person would be at Studio Terranova.

## In conclusion

We came established sociocracy at Studio Terranova with the hope that we would get connection and clarity in our work—and that, I can happily say, so far we gotten more than we intended.

It is more clear who works on ***what*** part of our workflow, and how we can effectively collaborate; who we need to hire for a new role to grow, and the authority we have to make decisions. I feel at peace that the way we are organized is in alignment with our values; we center both us as people and the work we do. I learned—and still am learning, a lot from my fellow BobaBoard/FujoCoded volunteers. Thank you so much for your dedication to making sociocracy easy to understand and pick up.

We took the sociocracy toolbox, Many Voices one Song to our retreat to reference from time to time. I highly recommend reading it and taking excerpts from it to give to others. We also utilized the “Silent Start” method for our retreat—reading excerpts from the book right before we would make decisions so that everyone was more well-informed.

Many thanks to AQ who hosted us, and Heather Dobbins who helped facilitate this retreat—without her help, I doubt we would have the clarity of insights we did.
