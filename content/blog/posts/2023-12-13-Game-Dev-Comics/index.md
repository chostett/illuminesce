![A man with a backpack and hopeful expression saying, “alright, I’m ready to go bugs in our code!” He disappears into a cave marked “our video game” and emerges on fire.](game_dev_comics.png)

I made this in 2022 while we were QA testing Terranova and we kept finding unexplainable bugs that would light [**@mabbees**](https://mabbees.neocities.org/) on fire

I like [**@mabbees**](https://mabbees.neocities.org/) the best when he is not on fire
