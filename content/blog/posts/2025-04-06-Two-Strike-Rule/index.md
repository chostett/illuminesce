One of the most challenging parts of an organizer's job is navigating conflict and harassment at our events and in our communities. As an organizer for events in subculture spaces like zine, game dev and design events for fifteen or so years, I have developed a **one-strike rule** and accompanying organizer toolbox to help navigate these challenges. I hope that by documenting this it might be useful to other organizers in small communities.

While this is primarily targeted at organizers, I will try to explain to non-organizers as well.

## Most organizers are tired

When I started organizing, I was not particularly skilled at communication or de-escalation strategies. I was a zinester, a game dev, a designer who wanted to find people who share similar interests. In one particular instance, I was co-organizing with someone who had attended a community event outside of Japan and wanted to bring it to Tokyo. I simply wanted a space to exist.

Now, to get that space to exist, I needed to learn a few things:

- how to find a venue

- how to get sponsors

- how to market

- how to plan and organize an event

- how to psych myself up and be extroverted in small bursts

None of these prepared me for my first experience with conflict. It was simply not on my radar, and I did it poorly (naturally, it was my first experience). And over time, I got a bit better at handling conflict. Each time was exhausting.

I read books on recognizing my own blind spots when it came to race and income, among other things. I learned about non-violent communication. Over time, the people around me remarked that I was good at handling interpersonal conflict, so naturally, they asked me to mediate and make decisions.

Being unaware of the mental load of this and a people pleaser, I said yes. This ultimately caused me to burn out. I started the group to create, not to organize, and because I didn't proactively train anyone to take my place I shut the group down to recover.

Once I was an outsider looking into niche groups, I often found similar traits in the organizers—they were the overwhelmed bottlenecks of the organization. I also found in these organizations there were [missing stairs](https://pervocracy.blogspot.com/2012/06/missing-stair.html)—that is, people who I was told to avoid because they put the community on edge, but the leadership refused to ask for accountability.

These missing stairs ran the gamut from "I have a strange feeling about them" to, "don't be alone in a room with this person, for any reason" level of danger. Sometimes they were members—oftentimes, they were someone who "helpfully" stepped in to help a tired organizer, thus securing their place in leadership.

The organizer became afraid of losing this person and so wilfully ignored repeated requests for accountability. Or the person themselves was contrite towards the organizer but not towards their victims. It's easy to say "have them take accountability for their actions" but commonly it was up to the organizer to define *what* that accountability looked like, *for* the victims while others watched.

The overall effect of a missing stair is that the community is less friendly and welcoming; newcomers either become targets or worry about being targets. Anyone who has a history of past trauma is on edge in the group and eventually leaves; *and once the people who warn leave the community, there is no protection for new members.* In general, it becomes a place for sowing mistrust, not healing and fun.

I saw too much of myself in this overworked and tired organizer. I feared that one day, if I continued on that path, I'd cultivate a group with a missing stair, too.

## Lessons from burning out

From this, I learned two rules of thumb that I try to both proactively communicate and embody in the groups that I run:

**Act like you live here.** It is not only the responsibility of the organizer, but each community member to ensure the space is inclusive long-term. If they see a behavior that's not in line with the space's principles, encourage them to confront it and request change.

For instance, if the space's principles are: 

- inclusion and camraderie amongst race/gender/income/nationality differences

- a space to feel comfortable creating

- a space to have fun in

If a community member witnesses someone making over-generalizations about a group of people, even if it's not directly involved with them, encourage them to confront it and de-escalate it. Look out for other people and communicate your own needs within the community.

**You are not your mistakes.** For me, this is an especially difficult rule to follow. I, like many people, have a voice in the back of my head judging me for my mistakes. If I screwed up an interaction, I'd browbeat myself for being a bad person, or stupid, or not enough.

This is why open feedback is important. It is the key to sussing out how close someone identifies their actions with their identity (or aspirational identity). It's at the root of when some white folks do or say something that *is* racist and disrespectful towards a black person (i.e. touching their hair without their permission "just out of curiosity") and, when asked to stop, respond, "But I'm not racist!"

I believe what they actually mean is, "the self I aspire to be is not racist," which, aspirations are good, but when our actions don't meet our aspirational self, it gets in the way of us taking accountability and changing for the better.

There's no growth in denying one needs to grow at all.

Once I learned to separate myself, the person, who was deserving of love and kindness, and my actions, which sometimes were in alignment with the person I wanted to be and sometimes weren't in alignment, I had a much easier time changing my behavior. In fact, I started to see feedback as a gift to help me see things I either couldn't or wouldn't see alone.

To organizers - being an example of this in our communities where we both communicate our needs and foster an atmosphere of continual growth and curiosity is one of the strongest ways we can encourage others to do the same.

I'm not saying leading by example is easy. It's *fucking hard.* It takes a balance of keeping ourselves accountable and trust; both of which aren't things that were readily modeled to me by others.

## The two-strike moderation

With these two rules of thumb in mind, here's how I've used two strike rule. Although the **two-strike rule** started as a way to *avoid* missing stairs, I started using it as a way of trying to cultivate more diverse spaces and provide a model for communicating behavior change.

Everyone in the community has two strikes per any repeated incident. The first strike is an understanding that everyone makes mistakes; the second strike is observing how someone responds to a request for change.

It works like this:

1. Explain the two rules of thumb above—**act like you live here** and **you are not your mistakes.** Tell everyone you might not see everything, but you trust them as a group to resolve conflict, and if they cannot, to raise an issue. Give everyone the name of at least two organizers that can help with navigating conflict. This is to avoid having one organizer be the bottleneck and, if someone has an issue with *that* organizer, they have someone else to go to.

2. Depending on the issue that is raised, you may want to ask clarification questions. I might ask what actions the person took after the issue, and if the issue was one that looked like a pattern or if they only have observed it 1x1. Repeat the issue back to them to make sure you understood it properly.

3. Assess the level of their emotion of the situation. You don't need to guess—ask them. Are they scared? Angry? Don't want to make a big deal out of it? Acknowledge their emotions.

4. Ask them what would be their desired outcome. [1] At this point, depending on your level of comfort with the person, you could provide suggestions and they will let you know what works and what doesn't, or they could come up with a suggestion on their own. Let this be a dialogue you're actively participating in, not making the person carry the load of solutioning. You may also want to involve other organizers here, with consent.

At this point, the person may feel comfortable re-engaging the other person themselves, or perhaps you as the organizer can leverage your organizer powers to make a general announcement and reminder of the rules of the space.[2]

For instance, if a group of people is excluding a more inexperienced member, making an announcement on the topic of **act like you live here** that all members, regardless of skill level, should feel welcomed in the space. Ask veteran members to check in on inexperienced ones to see what they need.

If the situation has high emotions, or the person *really* doesn't feel comfortable taking on giving feedback, or directly asks you after step 4 to help them, then proceed to step 5.

5. Once the desired outcome is established along with some suggested behaviors, ask for a 1x1 with the other party/parties. Although it's a bit scarier, I find it helpful to do this step solo as it avoids the other party feeling ganged up on.

6. Express the desired outcome and list some behavior changes that could contribute. Remind them of rule of thumb 2, **you are not your mistakes.** Listen carefully to their response and ask for clarification if needed.

Depending on their maturity and willingness to engage with their own accountability, this will guide whether or not we decide to continue engaging or ask them to leave.

**If a person thanks you and commits to changing:** they have shown both maturity and a willingness to engage. You can move on to making sure their actions match their words. Sometimes engagement can also take the form of:

- them asking for clarity or specifics

- taking notes

- them saying they can't commit to X behavior but they can commit to Y, as long as it both acheives the outcome and is okay for both parties, this is also okay.

In all of these cases, make sure to write down the committment and then observe the other person for a change. Remind them that they can enlist other community members to help keep them accountable to their commitment.

**If the person tells you to go fuck yourself:** they have shown neither maturity nor a willingness to engage. Ask them to leave. Temporary or permanent ban is up to you.

Sometimes the reception isn't that clear-cut and requires a bit more navigating. Oftentimes this happens when feedback triggers a defense response. It's normal to have a defense response to a situation one sees as threatening or tense and shouldn't be considered a mark of immaturity as long as the other person can work through it.

In my experience, there's two types of defensiveness.

### Defensiveness with the person's identity at the center

As mentioned above, when one is confronted with their mistakes, sometimes the inner voices come out of the woodwork to blame. Listen kindly; sometimes people are trying to wrestle with the inner voices that are connecting their actions to their identity. I'll cover the types of behaviors you may encounter and the corresponding de-escalation strategy.

Behaviors include:

- Expressing regret that is outsized to the situation and goes into self-blaming (i.e. "I can't believe I did that; I consider myself an ally..." or "I really fucked that up. I'm such a fuckup.")

- Providing a long explanation as to why they did the things they did, but no acknowledgement of how they contributed to the situation (i.e. "Things have been really hard for me recently..." or "I struggle with social cues and when it's appropriate to touch other people...")

- Outright denial (i.e. "I'm not a racist," or "I'm not that kind of person")

If you encounter these, you may want to de-escalate by helping the person disconnect their sense of self from their actions. Repeat that they aren't their mistakes; perhaps give an example of your own.

Then ask again if they'd be willing to commit to changing these behaviors. They can even provide suggestions of their own, as long as it contributes to the outcome. Be kind but firm.

- If they say they will commit, thank them and tell them you look forward to it. Make sure to observe if their actions follow their words. Remind them they can ask for help if they need it.

- If they say they will *try* but not commit, let them know kindly that commitment is not about succeeding 100%, it's about putting in a strong effort. Ask again for a commitment.

- If they refuse, ask them to leave. Usually a temporary ban will suffice; but if this is a repeat offense consider a permanent ban.

### Defensiveness by blaming others or denying the issue

I admit, I have a harder time finding compassion for people who blame others. I harshly judge this type of defensiveness in myself. However, defensiveness comes from the same emotional spring—fear. Handling blame with a logical approach is tricky, since you're being asked to verify facts that you may or may not have access to. You're not an all-seeing eye. Rather, let's respond to defensiveness with de-escalation. Something about the situation feels unsafe to the other person, and it would be wise to figure out what that is.

Behaviors include:

- Asking detailed questions on who made the claim, trying to call into question that person's reliability (i.e. "Who told you that?" or "You know (person's name) just switched their medications, right?")

- Making sweeping generalizations about other members or you (i.e. "I always get blamed for this kind of thing" or "I think you have it out for me")

- Outright denial (i.e. "that never happened")

If you encounter these, express surprise and curiosity. Remind them that their mistakes are not their identity. Encourage them to share from a more open heart and to refrain from using overgeneralizations: overgeneralizations and outward anger can get in the way of expressing vulnerability and prevent building meaningful connections with other people.

Heads up: even if you do ask people not to overgeneralize, be aware some organizers may encounter racist, sexist, transphobic, or ableist propaganda, sterotypes or generalizations couched as an "open heart" from the other person. This can exhaust a fair amount of energy to listen to compassionately and provide counter-examples. You can ask the other person to stop, full-stop, or ask them to leave and consult a professional.

Their viewpoint could unearth some fear of not belonging or being rejected. If they were able to be more vulnerable, thank them.

Remind them that they must **act like they live here**. The community is a space built from everyone's effort to make it more welcoming. How can they make it more welcoming not only to the other person but to everyone overall?

The suggestions should be ones that are both mature and allows them to take accountability for resolving the situation. If they insist the issue will be resolved if they have alone time with another person to "work it out 1x1," refuse and prompt them with different suggestions. The issue isn't just about them and the other person; it is about the community as well.

If they suggest alternative actions that are both mature and allows them to take accountability to the community, *with the consent of both parties*, ask them to commit to those actions, then observe them. Remind them that they can enlist other community members to help keep them accountable to their commitment.

### Observing actions

Someone telling me they will do something is much different than someone actually doing the action. Should I not see improvement, or a concentrated effort to reach out to community members to ask for help, then I'll ask them to leave temporarily to work it out on their own and then come back.

If this sounds harsh, consider: sometimes healing can be done within the community, and sometimes, healing is best done alone. Sometimes people don't have the presence or the energy to change in that moment. That's okay.

But if that then becomes the obligation of the group to hold onto them until they choose to change it creates, again, a missing stair - one of a person who is not able to take accountability and also protect them from the consequences of their lack of accountability.

When bans happen, if they are temporary I'll ask people to come back again after a few events; we stay in each others' circle. I'm certain it won't cover 100% of all the cases you will encounter as an organizer and the most compassionate way I know how to keep the space kind and warm while providing all participants an outlet to be heard.

## In practice

How does the two-strike rule work in practice? Here's some examples of real situations I've encountered in my communities.

### Case 1

One of our participants was having a really shit couple of months. Recently she'd been coming to events and using any available opportunity to vent. At first, we were open to listening, but it had gotten so no other participant could speak without her mentioning something terrible.

One of the participants brought this up to me; they said they had come to the group to have fun and unwind and were starting to dread coming if she was going to be there. We both agreed the outcome in this situation was **maintining a positive atmosphere to unwind.**

Some potential behavior changes were:

1. asking her to ask first before she vents

2. have a "venting time" for the first fifteen minutes of the club where everyone vents their frustrations and then keep the rest of the time for light talk

first request they made was to "get her to stop," but I pushed back on this. Would her stopping actually solve the problem, or cause her to stuff her emotions in? They reconsidered and instead asked, "I'd like her to ask first before she vents."

I went to her and asked her to do this; she readily agreed, admitting that she often forgot to check in with others. The next time she asked everyone if it was okay if she could vent for a few minutes, and the group agreed. After she vented and got some confort from other members, the conversation returned to normal.

### Case 2

A participant and I hit it off through our event. I invited him out to coffee and he seemed pretty cool.

Later, one of the participants in our event told me he'd been making misogynist and dismissive statements to other members, inserting himself into the conversation and telling them the reason they struggled with planning things was because "men and women are biologically different," implying that this meant women had trouble planning whereas men did not. They told him that he was a misogynist, and he defended himself, saying it wasn't his intent to harm. He never made these statements in front of me.

The participants brought the issue up to me, and I asked them what they wanted him to do; they said for him to stop making misogynist comments. Specifically, I pressed, what comments? They then clarified around making comments that took any physical differences men and women had and attributed them to men or women being better or worse (essentially, biological imperatism).

I told him in a one on one that I'd enjoyed our hangout together, and I had a behavior request for him; that I'd heard he'd made a comment about men and women being biologically different and 

## Footnotes

[1] In the case in which someone wants the resulting outcome to be immediate punative action or to call out and silence another person: ask them how this will improve their lives or the group as a whole. There are cases where the correct action will be to remove the person immediately from the group (covered in the following), but before we get to that point, we want to understand what accountability looks like for this person.

[2] Don't make a general announcement if the person raising the issue does not give consent. Taking a conflict between two people and make a general announcement of it can not only discourage people coming to you for future issues, but also encourage retaliation by others if the person raising the issue doesn't have an equal social standing with them.
