***Content warning:** contains talk of suicide.*

This is an ongoing series of letters I write to someone who is no longer here. She took her own life in 2014. I didn't speak to anyone about it for six years. In 2020, following another tragic suicide of a close family member, I realized I needed to externalize *something* or else I would be consumed with grief, [so started writing these letters.](/blog/posts/2020-09-14-A-Birthday-Letter-2020/)

It is highly personal. These letters help me process my grief, which follows no linear or rational form. I hope that by publishing them I'll encourage other people who are going through something similar to talk about it, write about it, or make something beautiful with it.

I have conflicting feelings about [my last letter in 2022](/blog/posts/2022-09-14-A-Birthday-Letter-2022/).

It is unkind to speak ill of the dead. And yet, the dead were alive once; joyful and comforting and messy and angry and depressed. There were other people besides me who knew you—the picture wasn't always rosy. It took me a year to get over our relationship because of some of the awful things you said and did to me at the end. When you didn't feel in control, you had a habit of accusing people of doing things they didn't do and feeling things they didn't feel. I found out later it wasn't just me.

I was naïve and believed that you saw some monster in me I couldn't see myself. Knowing that someone I trusted hurt me was too much to bear, so I turned the poison inwards. The damage I did to myself took far longer than a year to undo—and is still unravelling, piece by piece.

I don't forgive you for leaving.

It's awful to be left alone. To have to painstakingly kill any hope of saying the right words, someone coming "just in time" to save you, or a future where we meet and hang out again, laughing compassionately at our cringey teenage selves. I understand you were depressed for several years, and I don't doubt that they were extremely painful. But selfishly—if I can speak selfishly for a moment—I've had to process these feelings of sadness, guilt and anger for eighteen years so far, and will for the rest of my life.

It's not just me you left here. It's your friends and family. Each year they post on your Facebook wall, I feel a twinge of anger at how you could leave them. They love you so much. They didn't want you to go. They still loved you even if never called or said terrible things to them.

People forgive. They move on. They forget about small stuff. That's the beauty of memory. And even if they do remember, and even if they don't forgive you, do you really think they want you erased?

No.

I longed for the picture-perfect version where we were in love (once) and split (amicably) and stayed (close) friends. I wrote that fiction to heal myself. It helped me face the reality that you weren't perfect—far from it—and as much as everything above is true, it is also true we spent a lot of intimate time together confessing our secrets to one another. I loved that intimacy. I still love it. I crave it with every romantic or platonic encounter I have: to stay up late working on something that means the world to us.

I was majorly depressed. I tried to leave it all behind a few times. Walking myself back from suicidal thoughts *sucked* because having to reconnect in a world that I'd been disconnected from for a while feels like looking for water in the desert. Since then, I've lived through two other people close to me committing suicide.

I'm so grateful to my family who pulled me back. To my friends who, when I didn't have the words to talk about how much I was suffering, just sat with me with a hand on mine. It took me *years* to feel stable enough to confidently say I really do like being alive. I like living in this body, on this Earth. There's a lot of shit wrong with it, but I like it here, still.

I'm sad that the voices that told you to do it were louder than the love you felt in that moment. I never wanted that for you or for anyone. It was too soon. You had so much more life to live. I wish you'd seen that.
