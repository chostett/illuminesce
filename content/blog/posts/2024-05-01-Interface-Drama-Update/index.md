![Four up of four different interface dramas. Desktop Explorer, Home Safety Hotline, KinitoPet, and Orwell.](interface-drama.png)

Another big update has been made to [The Interface Drama Master List](https://illuminesce.net/interface-drama). Interface dramas are stories told through software. I don't think I expected how many of these games there were when I started this!

Thank you to everyone for your submissions! They are a gift.

Included in this update is...

* [Desktop Explorer](https://recurringdream.itch.io/desktop-explorer) by Recurring Dream
* [Home Safety Hotline](https://nightsignalentertainment.itch.io/home-safety-hotline) by Night Signal Entertainment
* [KinitoPET](https://www.kinitopet.com/) by troy_en
* [Orwell: Keeping an Eye on You](https://osmoticstudios.itch.io/orwell-keeping-an-eye-on-you) by Osmotic Studios
* ...and so much more

If you want to submit an interface drama that's not already on the list, please do so at our submission form! Your submissions keep the list fresh and up to date.
