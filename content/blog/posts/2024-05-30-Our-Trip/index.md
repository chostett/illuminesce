Three friends of mine and I went out for a vacation in Nagano. The sky was beautiful, the weather perfect; we rented a car and drove the windy mountain roads, feeling the breeze in our faces.

The hotel owner did a double-take when we arrived.

Picture this:

- one girl, dressed in a blazer and crop top. She looks like she came off the runway.
- another, in bohemian dress; flowy skirts and blouses.
- another, dressed in a white shirt from Uniqlo; functional daily wear.
- one (gender unclear?) person, pierced ears, wearing black. They've come from a punk show.

Unexpectedly, we became an anime crew.
