The first, as far as I know, interface drama using entirely cohost posts. [Tachygram](https://tachygram.belbeeno.com) by [@belbeeno](https://cohost.org/lee) has an "enforcer" style narrative inspired by Hypnospace Outlaw where the user looks at posts made on cohost and identifies "anomalous content."

[Check out the post mortem here.](https://cohost.org/lee/post/3282417-tachygram-explainer) I found it particularly clever of [@belbeeno](https://cohost.org/lee) to prototype the flow in Twine, since Twine lends itself to mapping out complex decision trees in a way that's much easier to write for than a typical Google or Notion doc.
