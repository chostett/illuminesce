Our New Year's newsletter is out! Thank you for your patience, everyone. 

Here's an excerpt:

*mabbees and I started Studio Terranova with a dream—to make a workplace that would serve community more than capital. We're burnt out tech workers that found a lot of love and community in the indie game community.*

*To that end, a worker-owned game co-operative just made sense.*

*Last year, we had to remind ourselves a lot of that dream—like a lot of folks, we were waylaid by both visa and financial instability that terrified us. We spent a lot of time reading about our rights, filling out paperwork and advocating for ourselves.*

*But we're still here. We are so grateful to our supporters and community. Because of a mix of client contracts and your support, we were able to survive.*

*We are also beyond burnt out.*

*We hope in 2026 to re-center our creative work and community to re-energize us.*

Here's to the new year, where we are more tired than ever, but like hell if we're going to give up!
