My friend recommended [Gottie Writes](https://gottiewrites.wordpress.com/2019/10/14/31/) to me, and it's so good—a thriller, written in the style of a fandom conspiracy. The author, Lauren James, talks about being inspired by the MsScribe drama on LiveJournal and JournalFen from 2000~2005.

I won't spoil An Unauthorized Fan Treatise here, but I am going to dive into some of the particulars of its inspiration and my thoughts on modern fandom, so if you're worried about spoilers, I'll put things behind a cut. Mostly this is about the MsScribe drama, its affect on the Harry Potter fandom and its documentation, now over twenty years after it happened.

Let me start off with a disclaimer: I have never been into ships that are popular. I get really fixated on niche video games and characters (see: SMT: Digital Devil Saga, Shadow Hearts, and the one time I got really into Knight, a side character of Weiss Kreuz: Gluhen.) so I don't think I can truly appreciate how big fandoms work.

Also, this post is not about the TERF darling J.K. Rowling. I've wasted enough breath on her. This is about the Harry Potter fandom in the early 2000's.

As an avid observer of people, I am fascinated by the way fandom reflects both majority culture and extreme subculture within it. I even wrote an article on [The Birth, Death, and Rebirth of Slash](https://zine.yesterweb.org/issue-00/index.php?page=7), documenting the boom and bust cycle of slash fan communities online and their history of igniting the ire of people on both sides who would deem them _homosexuals and pedophiles._

Now, to the drama.

It's a bit hard to find the archived post about the drama, but [I found a JournalFen archive through the Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20080604220425/http://www.journalfen.net/community/bad_penny/1074.html). It's a very long read, so I will summarize here: at the time MsScribe enters into the fandom, there are already some tensions between three fanwork archives:

**Sugar Quill** was a fanwork site that adhered strictly to canon pairings. Keep in mind Harry Potter was still being written at this time, so the "rules" around posting were: "whatever the mods want."

**Fiction Alley** was anything goes; all ships are welcome.

**Gryffindor Tower** was focused on one pairing: the Harry/Ginny ship. Unlike SQ and FA, they archived their smutty stories in a separate section that was password-locked.

Now, keep the password-locking in the back of your mind because _it will become relevant later._

MsScribe was a person in fandom who created her own fame; by allegedly making multiple fake accounts of both fangirls and haters and starting online arguments between herself and these fake accounts. People in the fandom would take notice of the drama, pick a side (usually hers, since the fake accounts were designed to be unpopular) and she would gain more followers.

## Christian Rhetoric of the 00's versus Modern Anti-Fan Rhetoric

MsScribe's online "haters" were "fundie crazies" or fundamentalist Christians; she designed them to be the most dislike-able versions of Christians on the web; the user **fermatojam** quoted Bible verses on his LiveJournal and at her in comments; the user **pottersginny** used icons that depicted an overweight woman with buck teeth.

Even though these sockpuppets and anonymous comments were _designed_ to have unpopular opinions and instill empathy for the victim (MsScribe), they weirdly echo some of the modern rhetoric I see.

Two things:

1. Fat-shaming seems to never go out of style on the internet. We've made _some_ progress with more queer authors/writers, but I detest the fat == bad person narrative. Fat folks get disproportionately more hate in online fan spaces if they show their faces/photos. Just ask anyone overweight in fandom; many are reluctant to post photos for fear of being made fun of online.

2. Even though these quotes were connected with "Christians" in the early 2000's, the same type of thing is being said by anti-fans, some who identify as LGBTQIA+, today:

From MsScribe's Christian sockpuppets:

* "I am insulted and disgusted by this post, and I hope God's love reaches you in time."
* "I love good fanfiction, but I have to find it on sites that are infected with this sort of evil." (referencing slash smut)
* "Anyone who writes smut and child porn DESERVES to be stalked in my opinion."

From actual quotes from anti-fans today (via [fujoshi.info](https://gottiewrites.wordpress.com/2019/10/14/31/)):

* "I do believe minor proshippers deserve redemption"
* "Stop reblogging from pedophile and incest supporters; no matter how cute or innocuous their art or writing may appear to be, it will always have been tainted by their disgusting paraphilias and abuse fetishization."
* "Some harassment is alright if it does persist just for their own good"

It's as if fandom said these things ironically in the 2000s, thinking naively that _everyone knows this is ridiculous_ and then somewhere along the way, these quotes were no longer ironic. Anti-fans were ironic until they were genuine. If anyone were to ask me "how the LGBTQIA+ community could ever say those things about their own community" I would probably point to MsScribe as an example.

MsScribe says she is mixed-raced, that she attended a funeral for her gay friend who passed due to HIV/AIDS, and uses her identity and behavior in addition to generating anti-black and anti-LGBTQIA+ hate, to draw in attention towards herself. And now, today, no hate needs generating—[it's real, masked at first as concern, but then rears its ugly head.](https://cohost.org/johnnemann/post/1675264-i-m-sorry)

## The Fall of Gryffindor Tower and the Influence of Collective Opinion

MsScribe's sockpuppets, **fermatojam, killiganhashope**, and **pottersginny** all were fans of Gryffindor Tower—the site that focused on the Harry/Ginny ship only, and password-locked its smut. In fact, **fermatojam** mentions on "his" blog that he appreciated GT keeping its smut behind a password-lock.

So, and this is my personal opinion, MsScribe did not initially _intend_ to paint GT as a "crazy fundie" site, her sockpuppets all mentioning GT as a place they enjoyed caused the fandom overall to see GT as a Christian site. My overall impression is that GT had as many Christians using their site as say, SugarQuill or FictionAlley, but because high-profile annoying trolls were saying they were using their site, it, and its mod team, became known as prudish.

Now—a single GT mod kicked over this drama bucket by foolishly saying, in response to a request for collaboration where their name would appear next to SQ and FA,

> _"The administration of Gryffindor Tower is not prepared to be included next to NC-17 archives, incest fiction, and certain other websites. To allow our website to be associated with those that we morally distance ourselves from would violate every principle we stand for."_

I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt here because other GT mods have stepped forward and said that _this_ particular GT mod had _not_ been authorized to speak on behalf of the admin team in this way.

MsScribe contributed to and actively harassed the GT mods; creating a community where she took actual GT mods' usernames and made fake accounts posing as them in a community called GT_Hidden_Room. For example, she made an account called **stolencocks** to mock mod **stolensocks**. She used photos of fat drag queens or unflattering angles of drag queens for their icons, so a double-whammy of fatphobia and queerphobia.

At this point, the GT mods, in collaboration with the SQ mods, were the first ones to analyze MsScribe's account and her sockpuppets' IP addresses and realized: many of them were using the same three IP addresses. However, because of their public standing and the vitriol with which MsScribe would shoot back at them when they talked about the uncanny similarities between MsScribe and the fundamentalist Christian accounts she'd created, GT ended up suffering a lot of public damage.

Eventually, the mods ended up disagreeing with one another and dissolving the archive. While GT's demise was primarily due to in-fighting within the mods, MsScribe's attacks on their community did not help. For seeking her own fame on LiveJournal, she contributed to taking down an archive.

What I think is interesting about this case is the meta-analysis the writer of the MsScribe story, Charlotte Lennox, provides; which is that GT had been estranged from the overall fandom since its foundation, and so, since public opinion had not been fully formed about GT, they could easily be swayed by misinformation.

Compare that today with centralized corporations and their black-box moderation style. Large-scale corporations could not be farther away from hearts of communities; they operate a business, and one that is not sustainable should they fail to get money from their users. Most of the companies I know that have captured the heart of their communities actively participate in it, engage in dialogue with it, and make their stance clear (and sticks to that stance) on questions the community asks.

It's easy to be swayed by any information if we feel like we don't know or can't predict the next actions of the moderation team. On the top of my head was when [a Tumblr employee mentioned community tags and directly told a user that erotic fanwork would be allowed back on the site](https://techcrunch.com/2022/09/27/tumblr-bring-back-porn-nsfw-community-labels/). This started a storm in the Tumblr community lauding the staff for bringing back porn, when what it was actually doing was allowing better tagging of posts.

Even though _theoretically_, we as a community have far more information than folks back in the early 2000's did to get information, it's often not the case that we have a timeline of decisions the mod team has made publicly for us to look at and say, "given what I know about the mod team, would they do X?"

Press releases get deleted, posts get lost in the timeline; the modern-day internet is very ephemeral. We rely on people within our communities, not the community mods themselves, to catalogue their actions and to interpret sometimes confusing and disjointed information.

Due to the sheet magnitude of users on any particular site, being a mod is a double-edged sword; you want to build trust with your community, but also...answering questions can be tiring. Moderating comments that are completely misinformed and out of left field can be tiring. I understand why GT distanced itself from the fandom at large in the first place—if they were a niche community, what common talking points did they have? But they also set up the fertile soil that was eventually sowed by MsScribe.

How does it end? Well, MsScribe more or less gets away with it. She seeds enough doubt in her detractors that people debate whether or not she is a mastermind behind her sockpuppets or not.

## The Chilling Obsession of Fans

This last part is a meta-analysis of Charlotte Lennox's analysis of MsScribe. Throughout this post, I've been referencing things MsScribe or the GT mods did; but many of their original posts have been lost, either to the LiveJournal strikethrough incident or through deletion. What remains is an archived version of Charlotte Lennox's timeline account of the drama on a JournalFen community called **bad_penny**. Below each of her posts, you can see folks in the comments debating or settling in with popcorn for the wild ride. In particular, I'm referencing [Afterword Three](https://web.archive.org/web/20080418031847/http://www.journalfen.net/users/charlottelennox/4849.html) and [Afterword Four](https://web.archive.org/web/20080416212603/http://www.journalfen.net/users/charlottelennox/4928.html).

By _reporting_ on the MsScribe drama, Lennox herself became a bit of celebrity. Folks in the comments were offering their theories and opinions and wanting her to continue reporting. Which is why I think it's interesting that the MsScribe story does not stop at MsScribe fading away from fandom, no; Lennox posts four afterwords after the story.

In most of them, she is attempting to truly confirm or deny some of the claims in the story; that MsScribe was stalked by user **fermatojam** and that Clarabella, who MsScribe claims was her live-in nanny, was a real person. _Then_ she gets a message from an anonymous user who has searched hospital records on MsScribe's _real name_ and claims they have found some of the things MsScribe to have said to be true.

Lennox, in response, goes into fan-detective mode and lays out all the ways in which this anonymous user is wrong—_by using MsScribe's real name to verify her records_ and goes so far as to post a map of the address of _Rutgers University that was sent to her by the anonymous user_.

> _I am perfectly comfortable posting that address for Clarabella because it is not a real address._

...is what Lennox says, but I have to say, _that's besides the point_. I personally don't think the line was crossed in posting the Rutgers University map—in my opinion, it was already crossed when _Lennox decided to dig into actual public arrest records looking for evidence of the name MsScribe used to identify her stalker._

Lennox also personally admits that the account she is posting under is an alternate account so that her identity is protected, but then proceeds to dig into public records to verify the identity of someone she may or may not have actually met in real life. She was worried about her identity being found out...but was okay with unearthing MsScribe's public records, letting the audience know what her current job profession is, and justifying her actions by not publishing MsScribe's actual name.

In courtroom dramas I hear all the time, "this is public record," but there was no crime in this case. Nothing but curiosity and the desire to follow the drama which, I know girl, is strong, but this frankly sets my hairs on end.

It takes a special kind of fixation to write a meta-meta analysis of drama twenty years later. It's a fan's fixation, which, when turned towards good things like constructing elaborate timelines to remind people of historical context, or writing a good smutty video game about their favorite characters, is awesome.

It is also dark. Very, very dark.

I like to remind myself of this sometimes, that I am capable of both good and evil; that there's a gray zone in the midst of the black and white. I don't condone MsScribe's actions, especially using racism, fatphobia and queerphobia to draw attention to herself, and I don't condone Lennox looking up addresses and public records to try to prove herself right against an anonymous comment.

I do, however, appreciate her putting together a timeline for us, because this is what has persisted over the years.

Thanks for everyone who read all the way to the end. I apologize for any typos on my end; this started off as my short impressions and turned into a novel. I don't think I can write about fandom and not have it be a novel.
