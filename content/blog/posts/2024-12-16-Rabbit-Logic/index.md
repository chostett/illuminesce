In literature, rabbits are commonly portrayed as victims; weak prey to the larger dark forces surrounding them. They are often killed, maimed and eaten to prove a point: *only the strongest survive. The weak will be sacrificed.*

We have two rabbits at home—Ada and Hershel. They are bonded; meaning—they are close with each other, but I've watched their kept pets since I was a child, and rabbits are some of the most challenging and interesting creatures I've shared a home with. They're both very opinionated rabbits (as most rabbits are), and this year, since I've been working a lot from home, I've had the opportunity to observe them on my breaks. They often squabble over food, loafing places, and other things, but they always—*always* make up.

How?

Here's the theory:

Forgiveness can occur between two rabbits provided:
-   there is no *active harm* being done
-   there are Ωopportunities for the rabbits to have repeat neutral or positive interactions

Let me explain what this means.

## Active harm
*Active harm* means that when you are in the same place as another person, that person is not trying to attack you (external harm), AND you are not being actively triggered by their presence (internal harm).

With rabbits, external harm is pretty straightforward. When rabbits don't like each other, they try to lunge or nip at each other. With people, that's *direct aggression.* Sometimes rabbits are petty and do things like flick their feet at each other or shun, both of which is *passive aggressive.* Flicking the feet is the rabbit equivalent of someone saying, "fuck you." And it's for small things, too. Hershel doesn't like the way my hand lotion smells, so if he smells my hand, he'll run away and flick his feet at me.

Rabbits are petty.

*Internal harm* is a lot harder to pinpoint—rabbits don't show stress outwardly, being prey animals. They do, however, have signs. Nose tightened, breathing increases, nose wiggles at top-speed—that's a stressed bun. For people, maybe the person isn't being aggressive, but due to previous bad experiences, you interpret their behavior as such and have a stress response. 

They may not be doing anything to upset you with ill intent, but you are upset. As someone who has very indirect, passive-aggressive family experiences and who frequently self-gaslights, recognizing *internal harm* was one of the hardest things for me to do. So often I gave bad actors the benefit of the doubt, it was hard for me to see 

I had a terrible falling out with someone I cared a lot about. During the falling out they said some awful things to me. I felt like shit afterwards. And seeing them again at parties made me feel like shit. They tried to engage me in conversation, but I wasn't interested. They pushed the issue, and I shut them out.

They really wanted to engage with me, but I wasn't able to. The way they talked to me—I really wanted to believe it was they who were doing active harm to me. That would make me the victim, and *justified* in my anger.

But over time I came to realize that my anger could be justified *and* I could also have my own agency to heal. Anger, as an emotion has a purpose and a reason. That itself is justification alone. I shouldn't have been treated that way. It wasn't fair.

But to allow it to take me over and control me...well, I concluded that being around this person was causing me *internal harm.*

In cases of both external and internal harm, I found that temporarily pausing interactions with this person and taking time to get therapy, practice self-compassion and journal helped me process my own feelings of anger, disappointment and sadness. 

Rabbits have a surprisingly short memory, and once you remove them from the thing that's causing them active harm, they eventually will relax back into their natural state, a loaf.

## Repeat interactions
Another key to forgiveness in rabbits, I found, is having repeat neutral or positive interactions. Despite their strong prey instinct, they are deeply curious and *very* motivated by food, especially bananas.

This proves a great boon to repairing relationships. If two rabbits have been fighting or don't like you, presenting them with a banana will wash away (most) sins. They're simple like that.

Humans, you might think, are more complex, but this is not so—I too, enjoy good food and a warm, comfortable couch or bed. None of us are above the small pleasures of daily life.

In the case of this falling out, we have regular friend gatherings with a bunch of other people I like. I look forward to these gatherings, and realized that just because they were also at these gatherings didn't mean I couldn't enjoy them as well. I started focusing on the small things I liked about the gatherings rather than letting any triggered emotions I have overtake the general pleasant feeling I was having.

Over time, I paid attention less to managing my own emotions to leaning into the positive things happening around us—and that positivity rubbed off on my impression of them. They got a lot easier to be around, to the point where I actually enjoy being around them.

The interactions don't always have to be positive; enough neutral interactions were enough for me to settle into a generally non-negative groove with one of my family members.

The importance here is *frequency* and *quality.* If your interactions are too infrequent, or you're dulling the pain by doomscrolling or spacing out, you might not get the benefits of repeat interactions.

That's it. No active harm, and repeat interactions. If someone continues to do *active harm* to me, then forgiveness isn't possible. If I do *active harm* to myself when I see them, forgiveness is also not possible. If we've only met once and will never meet again, it's less likely forgiveness will occur because there are no *repeat interactions*.

And that's rabbit logic.

## Why forgive at all?
For the people in the US who are dreading next year and all of the racist, transphobic and anti-immigrant policies that future. For the people who have heard calls from the left to "get to know your neighbor" or "cultivate community" but you have no clue how to since you haven't spoken--or know your neighbors.

For people in very tight-knit communities; there's simply no way to block a person in real life. We will, inevitably, have conflict amongst ourselves. Forgiveness is a necessary tactic to cultivate human relationships, however flawed they are, into something that is community.

For me, forgiveness is about accountability. If someone continues to do *active harm* to me, even after I have asked them to stop, then the consequence of this is a broken friendship. Should they want to repair the relationship, they must take accountability for their actions and meet me halfway. 

Hot take, but active harm may not actually mean that myself or the other person need to be ejected from the community. Do we need to deprive one another of community because we, collectively, have the capacity to hurt one another?

Forgiveness is a gift I give to myself, and to others. It's not something that is necessary for others, but it *is* necessary for me to live a life that is vulnerable.

I don't want to live a life if it doesn't have moments of vulnerability. Rabbits are often cast as the creatures who are killed first, the weak victims of a predator. But after observing them for a while, I think this is untrue. 

They're surprisingly resilient, and I'd do well to learn from them.
