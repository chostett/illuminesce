![Text: What is the greatest number of civilian casualties would you accept to eliminate a terrorist threat. If the box is blank, the error message below this says, 'Surely, you have thought about this?'](https://illuminesce.neocities.org/blog/posts/images/AlethiCorp.png)

This a deep-dive post on the subject of _interface dramas,_ games that use software to tell stories. For more information on what interface dramas are, [check out the FAQ in my blog.](https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2023-08-15-Interface-Drama-Master-List.html)

Brilliant.

This is from the "online interview" for [AlethiCorp](http://www.alethicorp.com/), a submission to the [Interface Drama Master List.](https://illuminesce.net/interface-drama)

I wanted to take a moment to appreciate how bare-bones UI like this can really add a chilling effect to the player when they're interacting with it. The affordance for interacting with a UI like this is functional, almost brutalist, which is why philosophical questions like this are so jarring—_wait, I have to pick a number?_ Yes, and you must pick a number "greater than three." And it is a required question.

There's no room for hesitation. Answer the question, or you cannot proceed. It pushes the player into discomfort. That's the power of using interface to force an answer—they challenge people to _pick an answer that cannot possibly fit into a box_ even the box is the only thing the player can interact with.

When I played AlethiCorp, it caused me to reflect on how people—messy things we are—are constantly forced to answer within a set of constraints. And these constraints are meant to capture what we are? What we represent?

Brilliant, and unsettling friction.
