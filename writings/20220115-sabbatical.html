        <p>As of this month, I will be officially leaving my job and taking sabbatical.</p>
        <p>Why do this? Was I not happy at work? Am I trying to change careers?</p>
        <p>I don't have a simple answer to this. I love design research, and I love design. In fact, I love it so much I've been doing it for ten years.</p>
        <p>Five years ago, I was sitting across from my partner, who was shaking his head. <em>"This is crazy. There's no reason we should leave Texas. We have a community here," he said.</em></p>
        <p>"Yeah," I agreed, "It is." Many, many tearful goodbyes later, we left. It's a feeling the both of us had; that if we took this leap good things would come of it.</p>
        <p>Five years later, we still miss our folks, but are surprised we don't miss living in the U.S. as much as we thought we would. And good things <em>have</em> come; warm dinners and new recipes, adventures with new friends, new hobbies and a new house we never thought we'd ever own.</p>
        <p>I look like a different person. I <em>feel</em> like a different person. Happier, healthier, and more confident. It helps that I don't worry about where the money is going to come from if our landlord raises our rent twice in one year, or how much car repairs or a doctor's visit is going to cost. We're really lucky.</p>
        <p>To be a designer is to cultivate a keen observational eye; to notice give words to previously unnoticed details and unspoken wishes. I've had a sense since 2020 that I needed to take a break to get some perspective and to learn skills outside of UX design. We planned for three years, and I'm happy to announce our efforts are bearing fruit. I couldn't do this without the help of my partner, who is working to support this precious time off.</p>
        <p>I'll be focusing this year on turning my eye towards not enterprise software; but other types of media and art. I want to understand my place in a world that is getting hotter due, in part, to the greedy actions of my nation.</p>
        <p>I'm hopeful, like I was five years ago, that if I take this leap, something good, something amazing will come out of it.</p>
