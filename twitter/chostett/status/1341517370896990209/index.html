  	      As someone who mentors, the most heartbreaking moment for me is when a young creative tells me, “I’m worried about what I’ll have to do to be successful in a society of men.”<br><br>I want to tell them, “Don’t worry. You can still succeed and not lose your identity.” <br><br>But I can’t. 1/4

  	      I wish my male counterparts were in the same room to hear these worries. The young creatives talk about silencing their inner voice, the one that says, “don’t treat me like this,” or “this feels unfair,” so that they can be seen as “easy to talk to,” or “a team player.” 2/4

  	      It is because we have yet to build psychological safety in the working world around discussing what people do when they encounter a system not made for them: split their personalities.<br><br>There is a me who believes in humanity, and there is a me who believes in succeeding. 4/4
