  	      Wasabi shoots up my nose and into my pain receptors and while my brain is screaming with every ounce of its being to spit the sweet out, my sense is clamping my mouth shut, saying, “you’re in the middle of a meeting!”<br><br>I look at the team.<br><br>We all start laughing.

  	      The sweet that had been passed out earlier in the meeting was one of those “roulette” sweets, where all of them were filled with strawberries, but only one was filled with wasabi. It’s a thing here.<br><br>Guess who got the wasabi one?
