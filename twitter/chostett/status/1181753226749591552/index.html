  	      I had so much fun discussing with all of you lovely people last night! I remembered something as someone asked me “when did you first encounter the word queer?”<br><br>The very first time was also the time I accidentally came out to my class via PowerPoint. I’ll explain. <a href="https://twitter.com/hellorainbowx/status/1181750227667017728">https://twitter.com/hellorainbowx/status/1181750227667017728</a>

  	      It was the early 00’s and I was into @garbage. One of their songs is “Queer.” I was really into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/3ppiohVRZ0s">https://youtu.be/3ppiohVRZ0s</a><br><br>We had a class assignment to pick our favorite song and make a PowerPoint slideshow set to music about the band. So obviously I chose “Queer.”

  	      I cannot explain the look on the student’s faces in a Texan middle school as me, an awkward teen, proudly showed off their PowerPoint that had cool star wipes and auto-transitions to a song that shouted, “The queerest of the queer” over and over.
