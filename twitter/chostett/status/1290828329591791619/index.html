  	      So many companies do this. The words used in meetings are "embedded ecosystem" or "seamless integration into daily life," which may seem like a good thing, but the dark side is the product can turn into a roach motel.

  	      Building a roach motel product is simpler than listening to a community and building value over time. <br><br>If you have a roach motel product, you don't worry about the trapped roaches. You worry about getting roaches in.<br><br>Hence, the focus on features for first-time users. (4/9)

  	      Why? One is lack of willingness to dig into a complex and headache-inducing system of interrelated customer/dev/marketing tensions.<br><br>The other is time. Many of my past projects were only a few months or a year. Nowhere near enough time to get the context I needed to design. (6/9)
