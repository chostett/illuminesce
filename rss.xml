        <title>Visiting the First Boy's Love Exhibition in Japan, Part 2</title>
        <description>
              For a limited time from May 20th ~ July 16th, the Kadokawa Culture Museum ran a "First Boy's Love Exhibit" covering the roots and history of the Boy's Love (BL) genre in Japan and abroad. Because this was such a unique experience and was only around for two months, I wanted to document my experience at the exhibition for fans in Japan and abroad.

        <title>The Interface Drama Master List</title>
        <description>
             Interface dramas are games that tell an immersive story through software and app interfaces. They are commonly called "desktop simulators" or "UI games" but I've found these labels to be either too prescriptive or too general to describe this emergent genre. And so, I'm making a master list of interface dramas here for people to play and hopefully build support for this unique type of game.

        <title>Interface Dramas: A New Way of Telling Stories Through Software</title>
        <description>
             Our generation grew up online. So it's only natural that stories told by our generation are, by their nature, defined by the online spaces they inhabit. In this talk, CJ and mabbees talk about a new genre of games; interface dramas, and why they redefine the way our generation and younger will tell stories.
