            <h3>what I value right now: <em>making space for creativity and studying how to take collective action.</em></h3>
            <h3><img src="images/25x25.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;work</h3>
            <p>
                There's three sides of running Studio Terranova: consulting, video games, and the operations of running the company as a cooperative.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the consultancy side, I wrapped up research work on sustainable rice farming in Japan in autumn of last year, and now I have the pleasure of working on some exciting projects with ustwo, a B corp digital product studio, and Tokyo Rainbow
                Pride, one of the largest LGBTQ non-profits in Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
                Projects are still on-going, so I won't talk about them in detail. The teams I work with are smart, motivated, and care
                about their design impact, which has been all the more refreshing to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
                The bulk of my work is bilingual‚Äîand recently I've realized I'm not happy with my ability to tell stories in Japanese. It's a critical part of my job, so to that end, I've been taking private lessons and reading books in Japanese to increase my fluency. I'm planning on taking the N1 JLPT this year as a benchmark.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm currently booked until early April. If you're interested in working together, <a href="https://illuminesce.net/contact">let's grab a coffee.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                As for games, I've been working with some lovely translators on the Japanese, Brazilian Portuguese and Russian versions of Terranova. This is my first time working with translators, so I've been reading guides for indie devs on how to best work with translators and localizers. I've learned a lot. I really appreciate <a href="https://lit.link/en/transneko">Ogawa-san</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniela-albu-a9829931b/">Daniela</a> and <a href="https://www.proz.com/translator/2807800">Yukimaru's</a> hard work and insightful questions.
            </p>
            <p>
                The operations of the business are far smoother this year than last‚Äîwe're getting into the flow of doing our own accounting, expense tracking, HR and taxes. That leaves some extra room for picking up some tasks that we haven't had the time to pick back up‚Äînamely, rebranding, and applying as an official cooperative with the <a href="https://ica.coop/en" target="_blank">ICA</a>. In the spring, we'll be doing our first Studio Terranova offsite and will start looking for our third cooperative member.
            </p>
            <h3><img src="images/25x25.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;personal</h3>
            <p>
                I learned a lot last year. How to start and run a business, how to brand oneself, how to delegate (or drop) things that didn't make sense‚Äîand how to be more cooperative-minded.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coming from the agency world, and in particular, tech, my image of success featured me being "the boss" of someone; which, no surprise, since that was all that was modeled to me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Since practicing more system design and design for impact, I was surprised how little talks on these topics featured books on collective action and organizing. Though the concept of designing for impact from the tech side was seen as a new concept, there have been activists and organizations and even designers that have long written about, and spoke on, the power and strengths of organized individuals and our responsibility as creators to society and the earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                This year I hope for some space to write down these learnings and resources I've been collecting. I hope to encourage others who are in a similar position to me‚Äîwho wonder what a viable alternative to working themselves to the bone for less and less reward. Who wonder how their life would change if it were organized around principles of collective action.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last year, because of my work and volunteer committments, I ended up neglecting my own personal hobbies; glassblowing took a seat on the back burner. Now, I have classes every two weeks to keep pace with my schedule but also continue to grow in making art.
            </p>
            <p>
                Speaking of art...during <a href="/blogs/posts/2025-01-29-GGJ25">Global Game Jam</a> this year I made a very, very stupid game called Bubble Butt. I wrote about how we made it <a href="/blogs/posts/2025-02-20-BubbleButt-Postmortem">here.</a>
