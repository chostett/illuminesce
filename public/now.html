            <p>
                Work is stable. I'm thankful to be working with a great team on some very interesting problems, though they are under NDA, so I can't mention them here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately, with one of our clients having financial issues and the summer having no new projects, the studio (and my personal life by extension) has been financially strained for several months. I'm starting to see some reprieve from that strain, which I am very grateful for.
            </p>
            <p>
                In June, Studio Terranova did their first retreat where we implemented sociocracy as a company—that became a talk done onstage for Design Matters Tokyo in September to an intimate group of designers, movers and shakers. <a href="https://buttondown.com/studioterranova/archive/weekend-snaps/" target="_blank">I made a newsletter post about it here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Truly, working with sociocracy and as a cooperative has been one of the most personally fulfilling, if not emotionally terrifying things I've done in my life. I joke that the cooperative is a bit like our collective baby - it's still young, getting used to the world and making a lot of mistakes. In Japan, there is little to no support for tech and games cooperatives; much less small businesses or startups. I've started to collect some community of Japanese cooperative founders, but the support and education is nowhere near the scale it is in the UK or Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is, to my knowledge, no one like Matt and I—bilingual cooperative founders working in tech and games in Japan. If you are, <em>please</em>  <a href="https://illuminesce.net/contact">get in touch.</a> I would love to feel more community during this slog of the first few years. Heck, if you're a cooperative founder who doesn't live in Japan, get in touch!
            </p>
            <p>
                As I'll get into later, I'm dealing with a lot of personal things, and thus, the localization has ground to a halt. We're slowly inching towards progress, so I hope to have more to share on my next update.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the meantime, we've released two games—a Steam release of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3725510/Help_Ive_Been_Cursed_With_a_Bubble_Butt/" target="_blank">Help! I've Been Cursed with a Bubble Butt</a> and a Halloween-themed game called <a href="https://illuminesce.itch.io/spooky-stylin" target="_blank">Spooky Stylin'</a>! It's an homage to early 00's dollmaker games—you can mix and match your hair, skin tone and outfits to make some very spooky combos.

            <h3><img src="images/25x25.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;personal and queer</h3>
            <p>
               Where to start...
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Context:</strong> I'm a nonbinary masculine person. For those who don't know this term, nonbinary can encompass many different things; in my case I was born a woman and have gender dysphoria about my body. This has eased by <a href="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2025-02-18-10-Months-on-T/" target="_blank">taking testosterone</a>. I spent the first thirty-something years of my life trying to "find a cure" without transitioning, and finally decided to stop fighting it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Am I a man or a woman? A man, if you see things in binary. I have short hair, stubble when I don't shave, and a deep voice. I am a bisexual man in a long-term relationship with another man. Personally, I don't see things as black and white like that, so I prefer nonbinary.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I had F on my paperwork, people were at peace with letting me be; but now that I'm starting to change over my paperwork, things are complicated. I initially didn't want to; but Trump's gender essentialist rulings forced my hand. I wasn't sure when I would get another chance to do so, so I changed my gender marker.
            </p>
            <p>
                This has caused the Japanese government to:
                <ul>
                    <li>force me to change my gender on my residents' card to M on threat of being in non-compliance with immigration</li>
                    <li>nullify my marriage of ten years plus the spousal benefits my husband has because same-sex marriage is not legal yet in Japan</li>
                    <li>deny me any meaningful benefit as being "M" on my insurance card - like getting testosterone covered by insurance because, as they quoted, "I didn't go through proper channels to get a gender marker change in Japan"</li>
                    <li>the "proper channels," by the way, is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>to never have been married (whoops)</li>
                            <li>never have had kids</li>
                            <li>to get a sex change operation - which many FTM folks opt not to do because it runs the risk of destroying nerve endings and sensitivity in the chest and groin</li>
                            <li>and <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/10/16/japan-court-rules-against-mandatory-transgender-sterilization" target="_blank">up until 2023, mandatory sterilization</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In being <em>in compliance</em> in Japan, I am now out of compliance. Even bringing up the obvious logical Möbius Loop to staff in government positions usually gets me wide-eyed stares, apologies, and mumbles of, "you're the first transgender person I've seen in my life" which...glad to be your first person who is patiently explaining to you my gender while mine and my husband's livelihood hangs in the balance of your decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
                What this looks like day to day is going to the local government office (区役所) 1-3 times a week, talking to confused officials on the phone, and going through the song and dance of explaining my most intimate feelings about parts of my body to officials who process and then deny our paperwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout this entire ordeal, I keep repeating the words some friends and family members said to me when I first came out: "all right, I'll call you they/them... but don't get mad at me if I mess up, okay? Trans people are just...really angry."
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Don't be that angry trans person.</em> This record plays over and over again as my patience, a rope holding a dagger over my head, slowly is eaten away by flame. Soon, something will drop and I'll be <em>that</em> person - and what will I have to say for myself then?
            </p>
            <p>
                The situation doesn't seem close to resolution - although soon, we'll be close to the next step, which is "waiting on an answer from the government." I won't be satisfied until my husband's immigration status is secured and I can be sure he won't be deported.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm tired. I want some respite from the constant government questions and celebrate my husband's and my tenth marriage anniversary in peace. On the bright side, this situation has really caused us to be a lot kinder and sweeter on each other - not that we weren't sweet already! - but I have been appreciating the intimacy of our approach of shoulders forward, facing the world together as a team.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes, when things get really bleak, I crumble and apologize. I tell him I should have stayed in the closet and just dressed masculine. Be a "tomboy" for the rest of my life. But even after the words leave my mouth I know that's not true. He agrees.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tokyotransmarch/" target="_blank">November 22 is Tokyo's Trans Pride March</a>. For the rest of the world, November 20th will be <a href="https://tdor.translivesmatter.info/" target="_blank">Transgender Day of Remembrance</a>, where the community honors the trans people who have passed on during the year. I'll be out at the march, hoping to feel some community love and support. At the moment, I'm keeping my head above water and trying to be as healthy as I can be.
