            <p>
                I'm in a very different place now than I was in May.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started and wrapped up one project on sustainable rice in Japan. I've hopped on to a new project centering around research and product discovery which should continue until 2025. If you're interested in booking something in the new year, <a href="https://illuminesce.net/contact">please get in touch here.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                I've also been very busy working on the business and branding side of our new studio. Jenn Piatkowski has been helping out with our identity and logo. mabbees and I have been making sure we're doing our due diligence with managing finances for Studio Terranova properly as well as creating company bylaws to eventually apply as a cooperative.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've paused working on the <a href="https://illuminesce.net/interface-drama">Interface Drama Master List</a> and going to the shop for <a href="https://glassart.neocities.org/">glassblowing</a> to focus more time on this.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes everything feels half-done and that I'm being pulled in a bunch of different directions; but then I look at other cooperatives and they feel the same. One of the biggest motivations to me right now is knowing that we're not alone.

            <h3><img src="images/25x25.png">&nbsp;&nbsp;personal</h3>
            <p>
                The little personal time I have has been going to volunteering at organizations both in Japan and on the web.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the months of June and July, I was involved in volunteering at <a href="https://www.zaoglass.com/" target="_blank">zao glass</a>, a gallery and workshop that is starting up in Higashi-Koenji. I had a great turnout of neighbors, family and friends at my first exhibition at Potter Cafe and was overwhelmed with support.
            </p>
            <p>
                zao glass is currently doing construction work to prepare the workshop to be a glassblowing atelier. I'm planning on getting back involved in October.
            </p>
            <p>
                In August, I volunteered at Citrus Con, an 18+ BL (boy's love) online convention. I connected with the folks at <a href="https://fujocoded.com/" target="_blank">FujoCoded</a>, who are building a collective of folks teaching web tech to fandom and am volunteering with them as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have blog drafts and a to-do list a mile long. I've been looking at what I can feasibly cut from my life that won't make me miserable. I've been practicing self-compassion.
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm <em>really</em> looking forward to the end of summer; I love riding my bike in autumn, and I'm looking forward to being more physically active.
            </p>

            <p>
                I've been out as nonbinary (they/them) for a while. Navigating that change with my friends and family has been a learning experience for me. Most people are confused as to why I'm doing this now. I'm over thirty.
            </p>
            <p>
                To me, it's an extension of my values. I foolishly thought every person like me had to make a trade-off: to live in society with people, they had to sacrifice some part of themselves. For me this was accepting being called a woman, a girl, a lady. I didn't think too hard about my own gender most of my life, but then again, I never slowed down enough to think.
            </p> 
            <p>
                Now I think a lot. I decided to go on testosterone to acheive a more masculine-cut figure. I've been on T since March. It's quite nice.
