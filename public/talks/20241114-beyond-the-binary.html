        <h3>Transcript</h3>
        <p>
          Thank you everyone for coming to this talk. I'm looking forward to spending some quality time with you this evening.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those of you online, please prepare a piece of paper and a pen. We'll be writing some things down during this talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is CJ; I am nonbinary, and my pronouns are they/them. I'm a designer, game developer, and artist. I've been working in UX design and agile software development for over 10 years at companies such as Apple, Goodpatch, and
          yamaneco.
        </p>
        <p>
          This year I co-founded my own company, Studio Terranova, that does design, workshops and video game development. I also started hormone replacement therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most people are pretty curious about why I am nonbinary or how I knew.
          It's a pretty common narrative for people to expect me to say, “I was very unhappy for a long time…and now I'm happy.”
        </p>
        <p>
          First, I'd like to share some of the happiest moments of my life from before I came out - my wedding day to my partner, and one time when I was sixteen and I went to a iguana reserve. There were lots of high points in my life before
          coming out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, I didn't like thinking too deeply about my gender. In 2020, the pandemic gave me a gift—the gift of experimenting with my gender presentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          I found out that when no one was watching me, I dressed more like this. There wasn't a “big” moment; just a growing realization that I didn't identify as a woman. Here's two photos after I came out. I still love my partner. We love each other more and more every day. I'm so thankful for him. I still love when animals climb on me. The main difference is that the smaller moments are happy; smaller, I guess. But more often.
        </p>
        <p>
          It really amazes me that other people would feel like this every day!
          Coming out felt like a breath of fresh air. I wish I could have done it sooner, but I doubt I could have done it if I lived in the US in my home state of Texas. I'm much more confident and happier now.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, aside from just now, when was the last time you felt curious?
          Brenee Brown, researcher and author of Atlas of the Heart, defines curiosity as, “recognizing a gap in knowledge in something that interests us, and becoming emotionally and cognitively invested in closing that gap through exploration and learning.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps you recently read a book about something new. Or maybe you watched your child experience something new. Having a child is a great way of reminding yourself to be curious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Okay, hold that thought in your mind. Breathe in. Relax. Let go of any tensions you had from watching the news, from work, or getting here. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Breathe out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Great.
        </p>
        <p>
          This quote from Steve Jobs always reminds me to stay curious.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>"Stay hungry. Stay foolish."</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          When I hear this used, it's in relation to continually being invested in exploring and learning. To be curious. But I've noticed that, when it comes to talking about gender bias or being nonbinary, suddenly we have very little curiosity in the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          We’re on the defensive. We distance ourselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          “What if I get your pronouns wrong?”
        </p>
        <p>
          It's fine. I make mistakes, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          “I don't know anyone who is nonbinary or transgender.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, now you do!
        </p>
        <p>
          So tonight, I'd like all of us to stay hungry. Stay curious.
        </p>
        <p>
          My promise to you: by the end of this session you will be able to understand how to think about gender biases, and will learn about design thinking as a way to explore them with curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, let's talk about the four steps to design thinking: discover, define, ideate and prototype. There are many variations of this process, but these are the most fundamental. Design thinking is about creative problem solving and making something new. It can be for someone else, or your community, or you. The end product of design thinking is always something you can test, whether that be a new way of
          doing things or a code prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
          You do not have to be a designer to think creatively. You do have to be willing to be curious and take risks.
        </p>
        <p>
          An overview of the different steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Discover.</strong> Discover means understanding whose situation you want to improve. Is it yours? Is it your team? Is it your community? If the “who” is not you, go out and talk to that person or people. The least accessible design is one done without any input; the most accessible is when you can co-design with other people.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Define.</strong> What is the problem we need to solve? There are many problems out there. Which one do we want to focus on?
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Ideate.</strong> This is typically what we see as “design work”—writing down our ideas to solve the problem, no matter how strange or simple they may seem. In fact, sometimes the simplest ideas work best.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prototype and Test.</strong> We take one idea and we ask, “what can we make that would solve this idea in a small way?” And then we test that with the people we spoke to during the Discover phase.
            </li>
          </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            This process is a continuous loop. Any time we prototype and test, we discover something new, and we make it better. This is the basis of how we make things that are useful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, we're going to use this process on something you might not initially consider design—making the world a little bit better for someone who is transgender, intersex, or nonbinary.
          </p>
          <p>
            A quick FAQ because it's useful to get everyone up to speed:
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Transgender</strong> - someone whose identity does not match the physical body they were born with.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Intersex</strong> - someone who was born with a mix of male and female biological organs or chromosomes. They may “look” like one gender or another, but may be different biologically.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Nonbinary</strong> - someone who identifies as neither male nor female, or both. They can also call themselves X-gender here in Japan. It is an intentionally broad category.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here in Japan, the gender binary thinking that there are “men” and “women” and they are very different from each other is much stronger and deeply entrenched than in other countries. So what's it like for a nonbinary person like me to live in a country like Japan?
          </p>
          <p>
            For context, I do not feel comfortable with the label she or her, wife, and recently, daughter. I've had varying levels of discomfort with these labels before I came out as nonbinary, but the feeling has gotten even stronger now. I am biologically female. I dress normally like you see me; masculine, and my voice is slightly deeper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people mistake me for being born male. Some people see me as a “woman that looks like a man.”
          </p>
          <p>
            My two friends, who are both biologically female and identify as female, wanted to take a trip with me to Hakone. I'm booking the tickets for us and the website requires I pick my gender; Male or Female.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first, I thought that they were going to check my ID, and I didn't want a fuss, so I picked what was on my ID. I have to stress to you—I wanted the least amount of fuss possible. I did not want to think about this. I wanted to have a fun time with my friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            This is what the form looked like.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we got on the bus, I realized that without my consent, the bus had automatically assigned us to the "Woman Only" priority seats in the front. I was dressed in a t-shirt and a baseball cap. I looked like a man.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was frustrating and embarrassing for me to be sitting there. I asked for another seat, but the bus was full. So I rode the hour and a half bus ride in a seat that said, “Woman Only.”
          </p>
          <p>
            I just wanted to have a pleasant bus ride with my friends, not sit in a pink seat that said, "woman."
          </p>
          <p>
            So how do you feel when you hear me say that?
          </p>
          <p>
            Or how about my friend? He's a guy who does manual labor, but also happens to be biologically female. He told me about the time he had to go get a screening at the gynecologists' for uterine cancer and the staff told him they thought he was in the wrong place. They asked him if he'd made the booking in error, or if his insurance card was printed wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>“No,” he had to say, in earshot of other patients, “I do have a uterus.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This is pretty normal for anyone who doesn’t neatly fit into a “born male, looks male” and “born female, looks female” category. If you have trans friends, you can ask them; they probably have stories like this. At first, it doesn't seem like much—but when it happens every week, it starts to get tiring.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think more people in this room can relate to this problem than just me. Maybe some of you aren't transgender, but I bet each of you has had an experience where someone assumed something about you because of your gender.
          </p>
          <p>
            So what I'd like you to do is take out a sheet of paper and write:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Can you remember a time someone or something assumed something untrue about you just because of your gender? Your name? What did that feel like for you?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            For those of you joining online, please get your pen and piece of paper to take notes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, turn to the person next to you and share what you wrote. If you are online, send your responses in the chat if you feel comfortable.
          </p>
          <p>
            So next, we're going to define the problem; as in—what is the problem we want to solve?
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm going to help you a little bit with this one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let's take the bus example. Is the problem me being nonbinary? Should I just “stop doing that?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Some people might say so. But I can't imagine being anything else than what I am.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is the problem the bus' website? Maybe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Is the problem that the clinic my friend went to had never met someone who was transgender?
          </p>
          <p>
            I would say that the problem is that someone assumed checking a button called “woman” meant that we wanted the “Woman Only” seats and that there was no need to ask me and my friends if we actually wanted these seats. <strong>They made an assumption about what we wanted based on our presumed gender.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In the case of my friend it is also similar—he looks male, and is male, but has a uterus. The clinic <strong>assumed that anyone who is male doesn't have a uterus and therefore doesn't need a uterine cancer screening.</strong> These are both untrue assumptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, the problem we want to focus on is:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>People make (wrong) assumptions about what someone needs or wants based on their perceived gender, without asking for clarification.</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            So how can we understand when an assumption is being made? How do we respond?
          </p>
          <p>
            Next, we’ll get into the fun part. Ideation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I want you to find another group of two, and together, write down some ideas for this scenario. Imagine now that you're designing a website for this bus company.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>You need to design an accessible way for people to buy bus tickets. You get a task from your team's senior designer. In her design, you notice that the form has a required question about gender; it asks the user to choose either Male or Female. You are not transgender or nonbinary, but something about the question feels wrong. The designer shrugs and says, “it's a part of our campaign to make women safer. We'll put the women in priority seating so they don't have to sit next to any strange men. Also, marketing wanted us to give a report on how many women and men sign up.”</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            What could you say?
          </p>
          For those of you watching online, take this time to write down ideas on your piece of paper. Please share them with the
          chat if you are comfortable!
          (Allow 5 minutes ideation time.)
          There is no one right answer here; only the one that you feel was the best move from your intuition and with the amount
          of power you had.
          Keep in mind when giving feedback in real work situations to state the facts. Ask hard questions like, "why did you do
          or say that?" or "Can you help me understand..." Take some time to listen and see if you can elevate others. If you're a
          senior in your company, openly stand up for your junior’s opinions if you feel they are right.
          If someone gives you feedback that you are making assumptions, take a minute. Pause. Breathe in. Get curious. Feeling
          threatened or uncomfortable is a great way not to be curious. Ask yourself compassionately, why you made that
          assumption. And if appropriate, apologize. Don’t over or under-do it; apologizing when you’re not sorry or
          over-apologizing does more harm than help.
          If you are sorry, offering a genuine apology with specifics is the best way to repair damage and move forward
          intentionally.
          So how will you use these ideas outside of the workshop?
          Discuss together in your group some of the ideas you’ve written down to the sample scenario. Are there parts of your
          professional work or personal life that could be made better by asking questions about what everyone is assuming? What
          are some actions you can take?
          Some possible actions might include:
          When a coworker makes a generalized statement about gender “well of course women naturally like pink things” ask them
          (with curiosity) why they think that
          Ask why simple sign up forms, if not medical forms, are tracking whether the person is male or female
          Include nonbinary and transgender people as your user group that you test or co-design with
          (5 minutes, sharing)
          These will be your prototypes. Write them down. Take them home. And test them in real life.
          And remember everyone: “Stay hungry. Stay foolish. Never let go of your appetite to go after new ideas, new experiences,
          and new adventures.”
          I hope everyone continues to be hungry and curious. To make mistakes, to discover and ideate new solutions to hard
          questions. And to get better, bit by bit.
          Thank you.
