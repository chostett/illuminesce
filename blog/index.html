      <p>This is where I'll post about my work, both in product and game design, as well as my own personal thoughts. I usually bounce around topics. Some posts may not have comments enabled; this is by design.</p>
      <p>If you like a post and want to support me, <a href="https://ko-fi.com/studioterranova" target="_blank">buy me a coffee here.</a> All the money I receive goes into making LGBTQ+ games like <a href="https://playterranova.com/" target="_blank">Terranova.</a></p>
      <p>Thanks for stopping by.</p>
