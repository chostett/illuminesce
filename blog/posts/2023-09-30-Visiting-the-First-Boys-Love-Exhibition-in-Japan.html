        And now on to Part 2: Tropes, Parodies and Modern BL!
      </p>
      <p>
        For a limited time from May 20th ~ July 16th, the <a href="https://kadcul.com/event/121" target="_blank">Kadokawa Culture Museum ran a "First Boy's Love Exhibit"</a> covering the roots and history of the Boy's Love (BL) genre in Japan and abroad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because this was such a unique experience and was only around for two months, I wanted to document my experience at the exhibition for fans in Japan and abroad.
      </p>
      <h2>Silly Tropes in Yaoi</h2>
      <p>
        Pulling back from serious debates on feminism and queer liberation, as the BL and yaoi genre became more diverse, clear, silly tropes began to emerge such as:
        <li>
          <ul><strong>yaoi hands:</strong> the trend for one or both of the male characters to have ungodly large hands or terrifyingly long fingers</ul>
          <ul><strong>Dorito-faced senpai:</strong> the trend of some artists, when drawing "masculine" characters to have <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/dorito-faced-bad-touch-sempai-san-and-shota-boy-/list?title_no=315" target="_blank">a strong, triangular chin similar to a Dorito chip</a></ul>
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        You could see this pretty clearly in the exhibit, and there were even parody works within the museum that played on these tropes such as the Japanese video game <em>Gakuen Handsome.</em>

        Additional note: Since I'm involved with indie video games, I found out that since <em>Gakuen Handsome,</em> the developers have put out a side-scrolling fighter game called <em>Gakuen Handsome Fighters,</em> and let me tell you, there's nothing more satisfying than playing a Dorito-faced senpai taking out the street trash.

        Now, they enjoy BL and like to talk about it not only from a fan lens, but from a historical and queer lens, too. If
