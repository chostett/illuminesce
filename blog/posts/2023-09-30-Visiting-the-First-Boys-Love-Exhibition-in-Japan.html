        <em>This is Part Two of a two-part series. <a href="posts/2023-09-02-Visiting-the-First-Boys-Love-Exhibition-in-Japan.html">Part One can be found here.</a></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a limited time from May 20th ~ July 16th, the <a href="https://kadcul.com/event/121" target="_blank">Kadokawa Culture Museum ran a "First Boy's Love Exhibit"</a> covering the roots and history of the Boy's Love (BL) genre in Japan and abroad. I attended during that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Part One, I wrote about the history of Japanese BL from the 1960's to 1990's.
      </p>
      <p>Rounding the corner, the reading corner of the exhibit boasted the many BL and yaoi magazines that exploded in popularity in the 90's. Artists that got their start in magazines like JUNE went on to make original series.</p>
      <p>At this point, BL had started to become codified as a genre, and the term "yaoi" was coined. As such, there were trends, which then became tropes. In Part Two, I'll be covering tropes, parodies and modern BL in Japan.</p>
      <h2>1990's Tropes in BL/Yaoi</h2>
      <p>
        Pulling back from serious debates on feminism and queer liberation, as the BL and yaoi genre became more diverse, clear tropes began to emerge.
        <ul>
          <li><strong>seme/uke roles:</strong> the protagonist and the main love interest were often given the role of either <em>seme</em> (top) or <em>uke</em> (bottom). These roles were often fixed and visible with the <em>uke</em> being physically smaller than the <em>seme</em>.</li>
          <li><strong>disproportional hands:</strong> characters had exaggerated hands and fingers disproportional to their bodies. (CJ Note: This is also known as "yaoi hands" in the English-speaking fandom.)</li>
          <li><strong>triangular faces:</strong> the trend of some artists, when drawing "masculine" characters to have a strong, triangular chin.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        You could see this clearly in the exhibit; manga like "Okane ga Nai!" and G-DEFEND had characters with distorted bodies that clearly showed who was the <em>seme</em> and <em>uke</em> in the work.

      <h2>Circa 2010 Parodies of BL</h2>
      <p>
        Naturally, once trends became tropes, parodies emerged circa 2010, both in the Japanese-speaking and English-speaking fandoms.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gakuen Handsome:</strong> a parody game based on a popular BL series, Gakuen Heaven. The players meet different boys, drawn with overexaggerated features and date them. (<a href="https://dlsoft.dmm.com/detail/cveaa_0023/" target="_blank">Game on DLSite</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Kankai na Fujoshi:</strong> a parody comic by <a href="https://twitter.com/_k_a_o_m_o_j_i_/" target="_blank">_k_a_o_m_o_j_i_</a> describing different "types" of fujin as garden animals. (<a href="https://twitter.com/_k_a_o_m_o_j_i_/status/830424320388190210" target="_blank">Original on Twitter</a>)</li>
        <li><strong>Dorito-faced Senpai and Shota Boy:</strong> This was not featured in the exhibit, but it is an example of the English-speaking fandom noticing these tropes and making their own parodies. This is a parody of <em>seme</em> characters having a masculine, angular chin and <em>uke</em> characters typically looking underage or being underage, or <em>shota</em>. (<a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/canvas/dorito-faced-bad-touch-sempai-san-and-shota-boy-/list?title_no=315"
          target="_blank">Original on Webtoons</a>)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Additional note:</strong> Since I'm involved with indie video games, I found out that since <em>Gakuen Handsome,</em> the developers have put out a side-scrolling fighter game called <em>Gakuen Handsome Fighters,</em> a side-scrolling beat 'em up where you play as characters in Gakuen Handsome and take out street trash.
