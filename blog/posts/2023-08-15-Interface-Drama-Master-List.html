        This is the <a href="https://chostett.com/interface-drama">Interface Master List</a>. It is a collection of games, known as "interface dramas" which use user interfaces to tell immersive stories.

      <h3>Don't see a game that you think should be on the list?</h3>

        Please take a look at the FAQ before submitting. I'm still smoothing out rough edges on documenting this genre, so info here will be regularly updated.

      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>What are interface dramas?</h3>
      <p>
        Interface dramas, also known as interface fictions or interactive narratives, are a small but growing form of game where a user interface is used to tell an immersive story. Though this list was initially inspired by a <a href="https://chostett.com/talks/202212-interface-drama">talk mabbees and I gave in December 2022</a>, we are not the first people to talk about or define this type of genre.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's some other examples of talks that have been given on this kind of genre.

      <h3>What are the criteria for an interface drama?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Game must be first-person.</strong> The game must feature a primarily first-person view of an interface, as if the player themselves is interacting with the interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Game must have a strong narrative.</strong> A focus on story and character development is a must. There needs to be characters the player is interacting with who respond to their actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Game must have recognizeable elements of a user interface (UI).</strong> These include but are not limited to: 
        <ul>
          <li>text fields</li>
          <li>buttons</li>
          <li>toggles</li>
          <li>dropdowns</li>
          <li>scrollbars</li>
          <li>icons and tooltips</li>
          <li>progress bars</li>
          <li>modal windows</li>
          <li>command lines</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/user-interface-elements.html" target="_blank">Please see this page for more examples of UI elements.</a> The game can be inspired by pre-existing user interfaces (IRC, Windows XP, iOS) or can be an entirely new speculative interface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The LCARS system from Star Trek is a speculative UI; see <a href="https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/12-incredible-futuristic-ui-reels" target="_blank">GMUNK or Ash Thorp's work</a> for more speculative UI examples in movies.
        </p>

        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The UI must be heavily used as a gameplay mechanic.</strong> For example, the classic adventure game Myst features points where the character must interact with an interface for a puzzle, but the main navigation of the game is done by walking around the island, so Myst is not an interface drama.
        <p>
          Secret Little Haven's UI features as a main gameplay mechanic. If a player wishes to stop playing a mini-game, they must navigate away from it; there is no way to "walk" away from the screen. This is a good example of an interface drama.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h3>Can an interface drama be analogue?</h3>
      <p>
        I personally have yet to see an analogue interface drama, but if it fits the criteria above, yes, it could be considered an interface drama. If you know of any analogue interface dramas, <a href="https://forms.gle/NKXv94fuBjSoZ9pv6" target="_blank">please submit them!</a>
      </p>
      <h3>How do I submit a game?</h3>
      <p>
        Please submit <a href="https://forms.gle/NKXv94fuBjSoZ9pv6" target="_blank">using the form here.</a> You need the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Game title</li>
          <li>Short game description (150 words or less)</li>
          <li>Link to full game or demo on itch.io, Steam page or website</li>
          <li>Tags that describe the game</li>
          <li><em>If you are the developer:</em> A 460x215 promotional image with your game's logo displayed visibly</li>
        </ul>
        <em>I will only accept games that are either the full game or have a demo released.</em> The game must be immediately playable in some format by players.
      </p>
      <h3>Who can submit to the interface drama list?</h3>
      <p>
        Anyone can submit a game, though if you are not the original author of the game, please indicate this on the
        submission form so I can check with the original author that I've tagged their work properly.
      </p>
      <h3>Why are you making this list?</h3>
      <p>
        Selfishly, I developed an interface drama and am planning to develop more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unselfishly, I love this genre and I think it's a really powerful storytelling format. In fact, it looks like there's a lot of folks like me who want to see more people play games like this.
      </p>
      <h3>I don't think you've tagged <em>[insert game name]</em> properly.</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks for your feedback. Ultimately, I will defer to the developers' opinion on tag accuracy. I am in the process of reaching out to each of the developers of the games to confirm these tags are accurate. If you are the developer of the game and feel that the tags are inaccurate, please get in touch with me at illuminesce (@) pm.me. Thank you!
      </p>
      <h3>I don't like interface dramas. They're not even games.</h3>
