      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>What are the criteria for an interface drama?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Game must be from a first-person perspective.</strong> The game must feature a first-person view of an interface, as if the player themselves is interacting with the interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Game must have a strong narrative and be story-driven.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Game must have recognizeable elements of a user interface (UI).</strong> These include but are not limited to: 
        <ul>
          <li>text fields</li>
          <li>buttons</li>
          <li>toggles</li>
          <li>dropdowns</li>
          <li>scrollbars</li>
          <li>icons and tooltips</li>
          <li>progress bars</li>
          <li>modal windows</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/user-interface-elements.html" target="_blank">Please see this page for more examples of GUI elements.</a> The game can be reminiscent of a pre-existing user interface (IRC, Windows XP, iOS) or can be an entirely new speculative interface. The LCARS system from Star Trek is a made up UI; see Ash Thorp's work for UI in speculative fiction.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The UI must be heavily used as a gameplay mechanic.</strong> For example, the classic adventure game Myst features points where the character must interact with an interface for a puzzle, but the main navigation of the game is done by walking around the island, so Myst is not an interface drama.
        <p>
          Secret Little Haven's UI features as a main gameplay mechanic. If a player wishes to stop playing a mini-game, they must navigate away from it; there is no way to "walk" away from the screen. This is a good example of an interface drama.
        </p>
      </p>
      <h3>Can an interface drama be analogue?</h3>
      <p>
        I personally have yet to see an analogue interface drama, but if it fits the criteria above, yes, it could be considered an interface drama. If you know of any analogue interface dramas, please submit them!
      </p>
      <h3>How do I submit a game?</h3>
      <p>
        Please submit <a href="https://forms.gle/NKXv94fuBjSoZ9pv6" target="_blank">using the form here.</a> You need the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Game title</li>
          <li>Short game description (150 words or less)</li>
          <li>Link to full game or demo on itch.io, Steam page or website</li>
          <li>Tags that describe the game</li>
          <li>A 460x215 promotional image with your game's logo displayed visibly</li>
        </ul>
        For sake of my sanity, <em>I will only accept games that are either the full game or have a demo released.</em> You game must be immediately playable in some format by players.
      </p>
      <h3>Who can submit to the interface drama list?</h3>
      <p>
        Anyone can submit a game, though if you are not the original author of the game, please indicate this on the
        submission form so I can check with the original author that I've tagged their work properly.
      </p>
      <h3>I don't think you've tagged <em>[insert game name]</em> properly.</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks for your feedback. Ultimately, I will defer to the developers' opinion on tag accuracy. I am in the process of reaching out to each of the developers of the games to confirm these tags are accurate. If you are the developer of the game and feel that the tags are inaccurate, please get in touch with me.
