      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>What are the criteria for an interface drama?</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Game must be first-person.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Game must have a strong narrative and be story-driven.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Game must use interface elements such as posting text, popups, shaking, rewinding, etc. as a primary way the player advances the story.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Game can be played non-linearly.</strong>
      </p>
      <h3>How do I submit a game?</h3>
      <p>
        Please submit <a href="https://forms.gle/NKXv94fuBjSoZ9pv6" target="_blank">using the form here.</a> You need the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Game title</li>
          <li>Short game description (150 words or less)</li>
          <li>Link to full game or demo on itch.io, Steam page or website</li>
          <li>Tags that describe the game</li>
          <li>A 460x215 promotional image with your game's logo displayed visibly</li>
        </ul>
        For sake of my sanity, <em>I will only accept games that are either the full game or have a demo released.</em> You game must be immediately playable in some format by players.
      </p>
      <h3>Who can submit to the interface drama list?</h3>
      <p>
        Anyone can submit a game, though if you are not the original author of the game, please indicate this on the
        submission form so I can check with the original author that I've tagged their work properly.
      </p>
      <h3>I don't think you've tagged <em>[insert game name]</em> properly.</h3>
      <p>
        Thanks for your feedback. Ultimately, I will defer to the developers' opinion on tag accuracy. I am in the process of reaching out to each of the developers of the games to confirm these tags are accurate. If you are the developer of the game and feel that the tags are inaccurate, please get in touch with me.
