        After Global Game Jam, we went to an afterparty that was part of <a href="https://www.igda.jp/2024/01/25/14381/" target="_blank">404 Community Days.</a> <em>404: not found</em> is an ambitious community project that promises to create a space close to Shibuya station for indie creators.

        Myself and several folks from our site, Let's Games! Tokyo came to the event where we met some folks from IGDA Japan, who is heavily promoting Global Game Jam in Japan. In fact, they are the ones who have been writing simple explanations for GGJ in Japanese as well as translations for policies that are untranslated on the GGJ website like the age restriction clause.

        As an organizer for five years, and one of the only non-Japanese organizers, it's a strange feeling to finally meet folks I only knew on Slack
