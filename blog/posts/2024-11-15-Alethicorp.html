        Brilliant.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is from the "online interview" for <a href="http://www.alethicorp.com/" target="_blank">AlethiCorp</a>, a submission to the <a href="https://illuminesce.net/interface-drama" target="_blank">Interface Drama Master List.</a>

        I wanted to take a moment to appreciate how bare-bones UI like this can really add a chilling effect to the player when they're interacting with it. The affordance for interacting with a UI like this is functional, almost brutalist, which is why philosophical questions like this are so jarring—<em>wait, I have to pick a number?</em> Yes, and you must pick a number
        "greater than three." And it is a required question.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no room for hesitation. Answer the question, or you cannot proceed. It pushes the player into discomfort. That's the power of these games, I think—they challenge people to <em>pick an answer that cannot</em> possibly fit into a box even the
        box is the only thing the player can interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brilliant, and unsettling friction.
