        This a deep-dive post on the subject of <em>interface dramas,</em> games that use software to tell stories. For more information on what interface dramas are, <a href="https://illuminesce.net/blog/posts/2023-08-15-Interface-Drama-Master-List.html">check out the FAQ in my blog.</a>

        Brilliant.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is from the "online interview" for <a href="http://www.alethicorp.com/" target="_blank">AlethiCorp</a>, a submission to the <a href="https://illuminesce.net/interface-drama" target="_blank">Interface Drama Master List.</a>

        I wanted to take a moment to appreciate how bare-bones UI like this can really add a chilling effect to the player when they're interacting with it. The affordance for interacting with a UI like this is functional, almost brutalist, which is why philosophical questions like this are so jarring—<em>wait, I have to pick a number?</em> Yes, and you must pick a number "greater than three." And it is a required question.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no room for hesitation. Answer the question, or you cannot proceed. It pushes the player into discomfort. That's the power of using interface to force an answer—they challenge people to <em>pick an answer that cannot possibly fit into a box</em> even the box is the only thing the player can interact with.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I played AlethiCorp, it caused me to reflect on how people—messy things we are—are constantly forced to answer within a set of constraints. And these constraints are meant to capture what we are? What we represent?

        Brilliant, and unsettling friction.
